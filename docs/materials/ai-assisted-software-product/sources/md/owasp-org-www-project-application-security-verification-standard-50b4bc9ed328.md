## What is the ASVS?
The OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Project provides a basis for testing web application technical security controls and also provides developers with a list of requirements for secure development.
## Support the ASVS
For more details on how to financially support the ASVS, see our [Supporters Page](https://appsecg.host/fundasvs).

## More Details on the ASVS
The primary aim of the **OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Project** is to normalize the range in the coverage and level of rigor available in the market when it comes to performing Web application security verification using a commercially-workable open standard. The standard provides a basis for testing application technical security controls, as well as any technical security controls in the environment, that are relied on to protect against vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. This standard can be used to establish a level of confidence in the security of Web applications. The requirements were developed with the following objectives in mind:
  * **Use as a metric** \- Provide application developers and application owners with a yardstick with which to assess the degree of trust that can be placed in their Web applications,
  * **Use as guidance** \- Provide guidance to security control developers as to what to build into security controls in order to satisfy application security requirements, and
  * **Use during procurement** \- Provide a basis for specifying application security verification requirements in contracts.


Get the latest stable version of the ASVS (5.0.0) from the [Downloads](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/tree/v5.0.0#latest-stable-version---500) page.
## How To Reference ASVS Requirements
Each requirement has an identifier in the format `<chapter>.<section>.<requirement>`, where each element is a number. For example, `1.11.3`.
  * The `<chapter>` value corresponds to the chapter from which the requirement comes; for example, all `1.#.#` requirements are from the ‘Encoding and Sanitization’ chapter.
  * The `<section>` value corresponds to the section within that chapter where the requirement appears, for example: all `1.2.#` requirements are in the ‘Injection Prevention’ section of the ‘Encoding and Sanitization’ chapter.
  * The `<requirement>` value identifies the specific requirement within the chapter and section, for example, `1.2.5` which as of version 5.0.0 of this standard is:


> Verify that the application protects against OS command injection and that operating system calls use parameterized OS queries or use contextual command line output encoding.
Since the identifiers may change between versions of the standard, it is preferable for other documents, reports, or tools to use the following format: `v<version>-<chapter>.<section>.<requirement>`, where: ‘version’ is the ASVS version tag. For example: `v5.0.0-1.2.5` would be understood to mean specifically the 5th requirement in the ‘Injection Prevention’ section of the ‘Encoding and Sanitization’ chapter from version 5.0.0. (This could be summarized as `v<version>-<requirement_identifier>`.)
Note: The `v` preceding the version number in the format should always be lowercase.
If identifiers are used without including the `v<version>` element then they should be assumed to refer to the latest Application Security Verification Standard content. As the standard grows and changes this becomes problematic, which is why writers or developers should include the version element.
ASVS requirement lists are made available in [CSV, JSON, and other formats](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS) which may be useful for reference or programmatic use.

# Meet the ASVS team at Global AppSec San Francisco 2024
You can meet some of the ASVS team and hear about using the ASVS at OWASP Global AppSec San Francisco 2024 happening between 23-27 September.
  

### Get updated on the ASVS
Two of our working group, [Shanni Prutchi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shanni-prutchi/) and [Ryan Armstrong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryarmst/) will be delivering a short talk about the ASVS project and the latest developments and plans.
You can catch them at 14:15 on Friday afternoon in the Bayview A room. Add it to your conference schedule [here](https://sched.co/1lIO2).
(Ryan and Shanni are also doing their own excellent talks at the conference so dont forget to check those out [here](https://sched.co/1g3Wd) and [here](https://sched.co/1g3aZ)!)
  

### Hear about using the ASVS
Shortly afterwards, [Aram Hovsepyan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aramhovsep/) will be giving a talk about “Maturing Your Application Security Program with ASVS-Driven Development”. In the talk Aram explains how leveraging ASVS for deriving security test cases can create a common theme across all stages of the software development lifecycle.
If you are interested in how to apply ASVS in your development teams, add it to your conference schedule [here](https://sched.co/1g3ac).
  

### Engage with the Community
Our new Community Manager [Matthew Aderhold](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewaderhold/) will also be at the conference so make sure you catch him to grab some stickers, talk to him about how you are using ASVS and get more information on how you can engage with the ASVS community! He will be there from day 1 of the training so you have plenty of time to catch him!
If you have contributed to the ASVS, make sure you let him know as he will have some special shiny stickers for contributors!
  

### We hope to see you there at Global AppSec San Francisco 2024

# OWASP ASVS Community Meetup - Lisbon 2024
We held a community meetup for the ASVS project as part of Global AppSec Lisbon on 27th June 2024!
Jim Manico gave the opening keynote to reintroduce the ASVS and the background behind the project and we had some [other great talks](#full-agenda) as well!
There was also an update on the current status of the standard and time allocated to work on the upcoming version 5.0.
You can see full details in the blog post we published about it: <https://owasp.org/blog/2024/07/03/asvs-community-meetup.html>
Additionally, we would love to get more community members involved in the ASVS and other than working on the standard we also have information about other volunteering opportunities to help develop and promote the project! See the “[Get Involved](https://appsecg.host/asvsgetinvolved)” tab above!.

# Volunteer for the ASVS
## Building the standard
We are always looking for people to help out with building the standards and discussing what should be in there.
You can find information on contributing to the standard in the [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
## Helping in other ways
We are looking for volunteers to help with the following tasks. We are working on the ASVS all year around and you should expect to have to spend a few hours a week working on your tasks on average. Some of the tasks may be more intensive such as building scripts or GitHub actions.
If any of these roles sound like a good fit for you, please get in touch! Students and non-tech people are welcome to apply, especially folks in the community who are trying to get into the security space but don’t know how, as being involved in an OWASP project like this can provide valuable experience.
The latest list of roles is here:
[Public ASVS jobs board](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VUgbA1xjwRaOL9o8SYQqoGGrFNNobmid_FGS-ELVAzA)
