## Real Design Scenarios
To simulate realistic design context, we defined 2 scenarios we faced in our ongoing design workflows at NN/G:
  * **Single-Page Design — Live-Training Profile Page** : We asked AI to design the [profile page for attendees of NN/G live online training](https://www.nngroup.com/training/live-courses/); this page should display their course list and certification progress.
  * **Flow Design — Bulk Purchase** : [NN/G is expanding to offer an enterprise plan](https://www.nngroup.com/training/bulk-discounts/) that allows teams to buy 100 or more credits for live online courses and receive a volume discount. We asked AI to design the purchase flow based on the outlined requirements.


We share the findings of this evaluation over a series of articles:
  * Insights on single-page design scenario: [Good from Afar, But Far from Good: AI Prototyping in Real Design Contexts](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-prototyping/)
  * Prompting tips: [Prompt to Design Interfaces: Why Vague Prompts Fail and How to Fix Them](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/vague-prototyping/)
  * Insights on multi-page flow scenario _(coming soon)_
  * Insights on redesign scenario _(coming soon)_


All the designs generated by the AI prototyping tools tested are [included in a FigJam board](https://www.figma.com/board/gLi4O1jr7Lo1AWQPZAdKXg/NN-G-AI-Prototyping-Evaluation?node-id=0-1&t=CbbP0fzNSeLIdup5-1).
## Evaluation Method
The evaluation took place in 3 key phases: writing prompts, generating designs with AI, and assessing AI-generated designs.
### Writing Prompts
We used a real design context to develop the prompts used in our evaluation. We started by gathering design requirements and artifacts (hand-drawn sketches, design mockups, and Figma files) from these projects, and turned the information into AI prompts[ following prompting best practices](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/careful-prompts/). To keep the testing setup consistent and ensure results were comparable, we used prompts that included all necessary context. To compare design variations within the same tool, we added a second followup prompt within the same conversation:
> _“Create an alternative design with a distinctly different layout. Keep the same context. Do not modify or change the content.”_
### Generating Designs with AI
We ran those prompts through each AI tool and collected the outputs. In some cases, we reran the same prompt in new chats to produce additional variants. [All designs were placed on a FigJam board](http://www.figma.com/board/gLi4O1jr7Lo1AWQPZAdKXg/NN-G-AI-Prototyping-Evaluation?node-id=0-1&t=CbbP0fzNSeLIdup5-1) so we could review and compare them side by side.
### Assessing AI-Generated Designs
We conducted[ heuristic evaluation](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation/)s to assess the AI-generated designs. Each design was evaluated through the lens of the main tasks to identify design elements, features, or decisions that violate the defined criterion. We also compared the AI-generated design to real designs created by NN/G designers without using AI.
## AI Tools Tested
We ran each prompt across 3 categories of AI prototyping tools that we considered to be most relevant to a designer’s workflow.
**Category** |  **Primary design output** |  **Tools**  
---|---|---  
**AI-assisted design** |  Static wireframes or design mockups with limited interactivity |  UX Pilot, Figma First Draft, Uizard, Stitch (formerly Galileo AI), Relume  
**AI-assisted**(vibe)**coding** |  Interactive code-based prototypes |  V0, Bolt, Lovable, Replit, Figma Make, Magic Patterns, Subframe  
**General-purpose AI chatbots** |  ChatGPT, Claude  
Note: We did not include AI code editors (such as Cursor and Windsurf) or command-line interfaces (such as Claude Code) as these tools require more technical setup and extend beyond a typical designer’s workflow.
## Single-Page-Design Prompts: Live-Training Profile Page
To match our testing to real design scenarios across various stages of the design process, we created **4 types of prompts** with various degrees of input specificity while maintaining the same context and request.
#### Prompt 1. Broad Text Prompt

## Evaluation Criteria
Each design was evaluated through the following criteria.
**Dimension** |  **Criterion** |  **Description**  
---|---|---  
**Goal alignment** |  **Design‑objective fit** |  The generated interface demonstrably supports the stated design objectives.  
**Prompt compliance** |  All requested features, states, constraints, and content appear as specified. No omissions or unauthorized additions.   
**Concept quality** |  **Solution diversity** |  Design iterations differ meaningfully.  
**Creative judgment** |  Generated ideas show thoughtful novelty and provide added value to the creative process.  
**Visual design** |  **Information hierarchy** |  Content priority is reflected through the proper use of visual weight. Important content and elements are visually dominant.  
**Compositional balance** |  Elements are thoughtfully arranged to create a balanced layout.  
**Consistency** |  Design execution is consistent and coherent across the interface.  
**Aesthetics** |  Visual quality meets or exceeds modern standards (appealing, clear, on-brand). The visual elements of the interface are intentional and support the page goal and band identity.  
**Interaction and usability** |  **Best‑practice compliance** |  The interface design follows established UX best practices and behaves as expected through the appropriate use of design patterns. There is no evidence of critical usability violations.  
**Accessibility** |  The design can accommodate users of diverse abilities: the content is easy to see and read, and the interface can be navigated using different input methods.  
**Responsive performance** |  Content can be rendered seamlessly across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) without content loss or overlap.  
## Challenges and Limitations
  * **Jagged capabilities** : Some AI tools impose strict limits — for instance, Uizard caps text input at 500 characters, so we had to shorten prompts to fit. Others only accept plain text or lack the ability to connect with Figma frames. We had to adapt our testing process around these constraints.
  * **Tool and model updates** : AI tools evolve quickly. While this evaluation wasn’t about chasing the “latest and greatest,” we did need to rerun tests in response to major updates (like the release of ChatGPT-5) to ensure our findings reflected current tool behavior.
  * **Free-trial limitations** : We kept the testing at the free-account level. Some tools require a paid subscription to unlock certain features.


## Lesson Learned
  * **Treat the evaluation like research.** We approached the evaluation as a research project — drafting a plan, controlling variables, establishing evaluation criteria, and standardizing the process for testing and analysis. Applying research best practices kept the work structured and allowed us to generate insights that were both objective and useful.
  * **Pilot test and iterate on prompts.** We first tested prompts with general-purpose AI chatbots before moving to specialized tools with stricter credit limits. This gave us space to refine and optimize prompts without burning through credits too quickly.
  * **Maintain strong documentation.** A project of this scale requires consistency and collaboration. We created a shared prompt document as our single source of truth and used a FigJam board to track and display results across tools. This setup kept everyone aligned and informed throughout the evaluation process.
