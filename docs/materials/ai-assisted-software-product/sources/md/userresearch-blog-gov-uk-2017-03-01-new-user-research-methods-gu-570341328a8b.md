# New user research methods guides in the Service Manual
Posted by:  [John Waterworth](https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/author/johnwaterworth/ "Posts by John Waterworth"), Posted on: 1 March 2017 \- Categories:  [Service manual](https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/category/service-manual/), [Tips and techniques](https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/category/tips-and-tricks/)
We’ve just published 6 new [user research methods guides](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research#user-research-methods) in the Service Manual.
The guides cover the most common user research methods:
  * Research questions
  * In-depth interviews
  * Experience maps (researching and creating)
  * Pop-up research
  * Moderated usability testing


Each guide has an ‘Examples and case studies’ section with links to blog posts that show the methods in action. If you’ve used one of the methods in your government service team, and blogged about it, let us know using the feedback links on the page. We’d love to include examples from across government. 
Our next step will be to update some of the guides we published last year. Before moving on to publish more methods guides.
As I said in an [earlier blog post](https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2017/01/19/three-ways-well-be-supporting-the-user-research-community-in-2017/), our aim is to provide a complete, basic toolkit for user researchers in government.
## Help improve the guidance for user research
We want the whole of the cross-government community to be involved in creating the guidance for user research. To support that broader discussion we’ve setup a new Google group - [Government User research guidance](https://groups.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/d/forum/user-research-guidance).
You can use the group to start a discussion or ask a question about an existing guide. Or to start a discussion about an area of practice that’s not covered in the guidance.
We’ll use the results of the discussions and questions to improve the guidance and keep it up to date with our evolving practice.
To join the group, follow the link and click ‘Apply for membership’. Remember to join using your work email address.
