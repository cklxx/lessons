> Abstract:In today's competitive and fast-evolving business environment, it is a critical time for organizations to rethink how to make talent-related decisions in a quantitative manner. Indeed, the recent development of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have revolutionized human resource management. The availability of large-scale talent and management-related data provides unparalleled opportunities for business leaders to comprehend organizational behaviors and gain tangible knowledge from a data science perspective, which in turn delivers intelligence for real-time decision-making and effective talent management at work for their organizations. In the last decade, talent analytics has emerged as a promising field in applied data science for human resource management, garnering significant attention from AI communities and inspiring numerous research efforts. To this end, we present an up-to-date and comprehensive survey on AI technologies used for talent analytics in the field of human resource management. Specifically, we first provide the background knowledge of talent analytics and categorize various pertinent data. Subsequently, we offer a comprehensive taxonomy of relevant research efforts, categorized based on three distinct application-driven scenarios: talent management, organization management, and labor market analysis. In conclusion, we summarize the open challenges and potential prospects for future research directions in the domain of AI-driven talent analytics.

2.1   Internal Data
Based on the described objects, internal data can be broadly
divided into three categories: recruitment data, employee
data, and organizational data.

2.1.1 Recruitment Data
Recruitment data in pre-employment mainly includes the
following types:
Resume: A resume or Curriculum Vitae (CV) is a document
that outlines a person’s background, skills, and accomplish-
ments, which plays a vital role in the recruitment process as
it serves to facilitate talent screening and assessment [4, 31].             Fig. 2: An example of parsing the resume.
It is an important tool for job seekers to demonstrate their
qualifications and fit for the position. Driven by the devel-
opment of online recruitment, a large amount of resume
data, typically in Word or PDF format, has recently been
accumulated. As shown in Figure 2, a resume typically com-
prises structured information such as gender, age, and ed-
ucation, as well as semi-structured information like educa-
tional experience, work experience, and project experience.
Accordingly, several resume parsing techniques have been
developed to extract the redundant information [32, 33].
On this basis, substantial efforts have been made in talent
analytics with resume data from different perspectives. For                Fig. 3: An example of parsing the job posting.

understanding of job interview assessments. Indeed, textual
interview assessments within a company are usually pri-

attention. For instance, several studies extract multimodal
