## Planning
Planning service 
     Yes 
How the planning service works 
     We work with clients to understand any existing systems and software they have as well as their needs and constraints. This could be through research or discussion, or it may require a technical discovery where our software architects conduct a deeper exploration of the legacy architecture. We then use this insight to explore solutions for implementing or transitioning to a cloud-based environment in a way that meets the client’s needs.   
  
We have experience of migrating large, sensitive datasets to cloud-based environments within narrow timeframes, and of synchronising the end of one contract with the rollout of another. We’re careful to factor in additional time for security checks and other quality assurance processes that are required for implementations of this nature. 
Planning service works with specific services 
     No 
## Training
Training service provided 
     Yes 
How the training service works 
     Our aim is to build simple, intuitive services that can be used first time without the need for extensive documentation or training. However we recognise there are some circumstances in which training may be required. In these cases we’re happy to work with clients to design an appropriate training plan. For previous clients we have provided in-person and remote interactive training sessions, job shadowing and coaching sessions. 
Training is tied to specific services 
     No 
## Setup and migration
Setup or migration service available 
     Yes 
How the setup or migration service works 
     Our support for clients migrating to the cloud or between cloud services is shaped by an understanding of the organisation, stakeholders, existing software, risks, dependencies and needs.  
  
We have a track record of helping clients migrate from on-premises providers to the cloud, or from one cloud-based service to another. We’ve migrated a number of services from proprietary systems into vendor-agnostic data stores, in line with government standards for cloud hosting ensuring data integrity throughout this process. We agree protocols for secure data transfer in advance with departmental security consultants and then implement transfers as agreed.  
  
We work with clients who hold data classified as official, secret and top secret and can support secure migrations for all classifications.  
If needed we can work directly with your existing vendors to ensure a smooth and effective migration. 
Setup or migration service is for specific cloud services 
     No 
## Quality assurance and performance testing
Quality assurance and performance testing service 
     Yes 
How the quality assurance and performance testing works 
     We use government assured patterns and standards (such as the GOV.UK design system) and ways of working to ensure content and designs are of a consistently high quality. We carry out usability testing on all new software and iterate based on the findings.  
  
For software and data we use a blend of automated and manual testing to quality assess releases. This includes automation testing, non-functional testing, performance testing, exploratory testing and functional testing. We integrate performance testing as part of our continuous integration (CI), deployment (CD) and delivery approach so it’s built into everyday development practices. We also engage our clients in quality assurance by making early versions of software available for review as soon as possible. 
## Security testing

We can provide support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year - if necessary. We also work with ticketing platforms including ServiceNow and Jira Service Desk and can integrate as needed with your existing processes including playbooks.  
  
In line with DevOps principles, maintenance and optimisation of the software we produce is a key part of our ethos, which is why we’re proactive about alerting clients to issues and making recommendations for improvements.  
  
We have a defined/tested process for incident management that follows IT Ops best practices.

Fighting climate change
We're dedicated to exploring innovative strategies to lower energy consumption and mitigate our environmental impact. This includes partnering with ethical suppliers committed to eco-friendly practices, prioritising environmentally responsible goods and services, and advocating for remote meetings to reduce travel. Additionally, we actively promote the use of public transport for face-to-face engagements and engage our employees in sustainability programmes, providing education on climate change to cultivate an environmentally conscious culture. Our commitment extends to recycling or reusing materials wherever possible, selecting premises with recycling policies, and responsibly managing energy usage both in our office and when telecommuting. We've developed digital services for clients to minimise paper usage and encourage them to adopt renewable energy sources for their operations. Furthermore, we collaborate with like-minded businesses to amplify our impact on climate action, sharing best practices and resources to collectively address climate change.
Tackling economic inequality
Marvell Consulting and our supply chain are committed to creating opportunities for those facing employment barriers through various initiatives: mentoring young BAME individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds who aspire to become professional software engineers via the Level Up programme with helpmelevelup.org; actively participating as STEM ambassadors at careers fairs in underprivileged areas like Catford, South East London; membership in the Disability Confident employer scheme to facilitate employment for disabled individuals; signing the Tech Talent Charter to foster inclusive recruitment practices and maintain a diverse workforce; supporting regional tech skills and data literacy growth by organising and volunteering at OpenDataCamp across locations such as Belfast, Aberdeen, Bristol, Cardiff, and Wolverhampton; conducting regular pay equity audits to rectify any wage disparities based on gender, race, or other factors; and maintaining an internal training programme for junior staff, which will be further developed, released under an open licence, and expanded in collaboration with organisations like Tech Redefined to offer free training sessions to women and BAME individuals seeking to upskill for roles in the technology sector.
Equal opportunity
At Marvell Consulting, our commitment to fairness extends across every aspect of our operations, ensuring equal treatment, access, and advancement opportunities for all employees, regardless of race, gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, religion, or any other characteristic. We foster an inclusive work environment where everyone can thrive by implementing various measures: adopting fair recruitment practices such as inclusive job adverts, reaching out to diverse ethnic backgrounds, anonymising applications, and ensuring diverse recruitment panels; maintaining a flat hierarchy valuing every perspective equally; encouraging open feedback in team meetings and adapting our practices based on staff input; supporting flexible working arrangements to accommodate disadvantaged groups; conducting regular pay equity audits to rectify any disparities; providing training programs on diversity, inclusion, and mitigating unconscious bias; facilitating the use of accessible tools; involving staff in local community engagement across multiple locations; and partnering with diverse suppliers to promote economic inclusion and empowerment, supporting small businesses owned by minorities, women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people with disabilities.
Wellbeing
At Marvell Consulting, we're deeply invested in the prosperity of the communities we operate in, understanding that our success is intertwined with their well-being. Our commitment to making a positive impact extends through responsible business practices, environmental consciousness, and active community involvement. Prioritising well-being is at the heart of our ethos, demonstrated by initiatives such as adopting the Thriving at Work standards and fostering Mental Health at Work, having a trained mental health first aider on our team, encouraging regular breaks for physical and mental health, offering flexible working arrangements to support work-life balance, conducting regular check-ins to address mental health concerns promptly, ensuring ergonomic workplace setups through assessments, hosting social events for team bonding, fostering a supportive work environment with opportunities for growth, development, and transparent communication, and developing user-centric digital services that contribute to community well-being. These efforts underscore our dedication to nurturing a positive working environment where every individual can thrive.
