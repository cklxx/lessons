## Planning
Planning service 
     Yes 
How the planning service works 
     With complex service transformation, success comes from understanding the end goal from the outset. Planning the process incrementally is better than replacing the full architecture in a single high-risk release.  
We engage the team and stakeholders in building a service vision statement, eliciting critical success criteria, developing a release roadmap. These strategic artifacts – often created in early workshops - can subsequently be used as a shared frame of reference when navigating through the detail of user story priorities, research findings, policy implementation, systems integration issues and so on.  
We maintain tracking information, using this to keep the team aware of progress towards the goal, and uses ceremonies such as the daily standups and planning workshops to keep the team informed, involved and motivated. 
Planning service works with specific services 
     No 
## Training
Training service provided 
     Yes 
How the training service works 
     A key element of Valtech’s approach is training and mentoring to build a sustainable in house capability. Most of our projects include some aspect of enablement ranging from pairing and co-working, to formal coaching. We encourage training and learning opportunities such as communities of practice or hack-a-thons. We frequently undertake transition projects through jointly-resourced teams, with project responsibility visibly migrating over time via positive tracking towards in-house team members as the engagement ramps down. This ensures continuity of service and the ability to continue delivery of the service as it draws to a close. It is important to understand, as early as possible, our clients’ ambition for cloud transformation delivery and support capability. Activities to support them in achieving this will be mutually agreed and scheduled alongside meeting critical delivery objectives. 
Training is tied to specific services 
     No 
## Setup and migration
Setup or migration service available 
     Yes 
How the setup or migration service works 
     We have helped numerous Government departments successfully plan and implement migration from both legacy applications to secure cloud services, and also between different cloud services. We’re agnostic, choosing the appropriate provider based on client-specific criteria.  
We leverage our extensive experience of GDS Exemplar programmes and operate a phased approach aligned to the GDS Service Manual:  
◊ Discovery – before selecting a solution, to identify the requirements, constraints and user needs for the proposed cloud-based services  
◊ Alpha – whilst Discovery identifies “should we?”, Alpha answers “can we” and “if we can then how?”, through design and development of a user needs-based proof of concept, within target cloud services  
◊ Beta – Valtech support implementation, integration, deployment and migration to the new service through a Beta phase. We deliver an insight-driven Minimum Viable Product (MVP), testing, learning and if appropriate iteratively enhancing and optimising the service until ready for GDS Service Assessment before going Live  
◊ Live – where Valtech might support iteratively improving the service and also maintaining and optimising the service to ensure high level of availability and usability by its end users 
Setup or migration service is for specific cloud services 
     No 
## Quality assurance and performance testing
Quality assurance and performance testing service 
     Yes 
How the quality assurance and performance testing works 
     Valtech’s Testing and Quality Assurance approach begins with application of engineering discipline and development practices built around the principle of defect avoidance. We also automate testing wherever possible to reduce undue effort and cost. Quality is something that we manage with the customer throughout the entire development process. We will ensure that stories are expressed correctly and describe features that are deliverable independently from other stories. Each story will be accompanied with acceptance criteria that will be created in collaboration with the internal or Valtech QA. These acceptance criteria and accompanying specifications will be reviewed and approved by the QA, BA and Team Lead before it enters the sprint. During the task breakdown the whole team will provide input to ensure the tasks will deliver the required output. All development undertaken by Valtech will consider performance implications, and we would expect specific performance metrics to form part of the non-functional requirements (NFR) for key aspects of the system. If specific metrics form part of the NFR we would work with the client to undertake specific performance testing of that feature. We can also offer integration and accessibility testing as needed to support the requirements for each engagement.

How the support service works 
     Developing and deploying a customer-focussed, cloud-based digital service to a production environment is a huge achievement, but in terms of realising business benefits it’s just the start. In order to maximise benefits, the service must be maintained and optimised to ensure a continued high level of availability and usability by its end users. Valtech provide flexible and comprehensive support for both the digital service and the environments in which it operates.  
We offer a variety of support frameworks, ranging from a standard Bronze, Silver, Gold option, through to a fully bespoke solution to meet your specific needs.  
While remaining fully compliant with the ITIL framework, we leverage our proven understanding of the Agile philosophy to constantly refine and shape the service we provide, to achieve maximum value and eliminate the waste associated with “one size fits all” offerings.

Fighting climate change
There is a huge challenge in front of us as human beings, as we all know, and things need to change. As a large and growing organization, we see it as our responsibility at Valtech to take action/and to encourage a ripple effect amongst our employees, clients, partners, and wider sphere of influence.” Olivier Padiou, Valtech CEO  
Global emissions reduction underpins our strategy. In October 2023, SBTi validated Valtech’s global emissions targets:   
• Our Near-term target is a 50-55% reduction in emissions by 2030  
• Our Net-zero target is a 90-97% reduction in emissions by 2040  
We opted for SBTi validation due to their global leadership and rigour. Our ambitious PPN-063-based UK Carbon Reduction Plan complements our global strategy.  
Our dedicated Global Sustainability Director coordinates initiatives and empowers local Sustainability Champions to implement tailored solutions. Our UK Environmental Policy emphasises recycling, minimising paper usage, enhancing office energy efficiency, greener commuting and our electric vehicle salary sacrifice scheme, and sourcing sustainable laptops. Each Valtech office worldwide develops its own emissions reduction roadmap and local sustainability events.  
Within our projects, we calculate and minimise software carbon intensity, employ demand shaping techniques in cloud hosting architectures, and advise on carbon-efficient coding languages. We prioritise environmentally friendly practices in project conduct, such as setting carbon goals and utilising carbon trackers within our teams.  
We actively support clients in reducing emissions through sustainable practices, providing training on green software development, running events like our sustainability hack with Ofgem, and centring team building activities around green initiatives such as peat bog restoration with the Woodland Trust. Our commitment extends to initiatives like the "Creating a Sustainable Digital Landscape" podcast, where industry experts provide insights to guide towards a greener digital future. We strive to make a positive impact on the environment within our operations and beyond.
Tackling economic inequality
Valtech's comprehensive strategies and initiatives foster economic equality and ensure a fair and inclusive environment for all stakeholders:   
1\. Diverse Supply Chain - We drive innovation and support growth opportunities for underrepresented businesses through collaborations with diverse suppliers like AppyWay, a Kerbside management SME, not only delivering value to clients like Department for Transport (DfT) but also contributing to the growth of specialist organizations.   
2\. Supporting SMEs: As a founding member of the MACH Alliance, we advocate for open tech ecosystems that promote innovation and agility. By embracing Microservices-based, API-first, Cloud-native, and Headless technologies, we empower organizations to navigate complexities of the modern technology landscape and unlock new opportunities for growth.   
3\. Promoting ethics in our supply chain: Our Supplier Ethics Policy and mandatory ethics training for suppliers ensure integrity. Suppliers complete Modern Slavery Questionnaires during onboarding and contractors sign up to specific prevention clauses in their contracts.   
4\. Influencing Stakeholders and Communities: We empower staff to make a positive impact by sharing skills and expertise through initiatives like #homelesshack, an event which brought together BT, Transport for Greater Manchester, UKGovCamp and The Albert Kennedy Trust to use technology to solve local problems.   
5\. Equality in recruitment: We target positions where minorities are underrepresented by sponsoring and partnering with groups including Athena Hack (women and non-binary tech community) and MyGwork (LGBTQ+ professionals recruitment/networking) to create diverse candidate pools.   
6\. Workforce progression: Our Accelerating into Leadership program allocates employees from underrepresented groups a sponsor in the Leadership team. Our Belonging Groups (parents, underrepresented genders, LGBTQ+, neurodiversity) which monitor and act on any inequality and build confidence in our workforce to enable in-work progression.   
7\. Addressing Modern Slavery Risks: Our proactive approach includes employee assistance programs, whistleblowing policies, compliance training, and regular audits to ensure adherence to ethical standards and legal requirements.
Equal opportunity
Valtech is committed to promoting equal opportunity and inclusivity across all aspects of our operations. As a Disability Confident Employer, we prioritize ensuring that our recruitment processes are inclusive and accessible to candidates of all abilities. We actively encourage applicants from diverse backgrounds and offer interviews to all individuals who meet the minimum requirements for our vacancies.   
We provide training and development opportunities that empower our employees to overcome barriers and thrive in an inclusive environment.   
We hold annual training sessions to promote equality, diversity, and inclusion, reinforcing our commitment to creating a workplace where everyone feels valued and respected. We enforce compliance with equal opportunities principles in our recruitment processes and workplace policies, ensuring that all employees are treated fairly and without discrimination based on any of the nine protected characteristics outlined in the Equality Act 2010.   
Our efforts to promote workforce equality and progression extend beyond recruitment to include initiatives aimed at supporting career advancement and addressing areas of inequality within our organization. Through targeted sponsorship and partnerships with groups such as Athena Hack and MyGwork, we actively work to diversify our candidate pools and promote gender and LGBTQ+ inclusivity. Our Belonging Groups play a crucial role in monitoring and addressing instances of inequality, while also spearheading policy development to foster a more inclusive workplace culture.   
Our in-work progression initiatives, such as the Accelerating into Leadership program, provide employees from underrepresented groups with the support and resources they need to advance their careers. Transparent capability matrices and biannual equal pay audits ensure that our promotion processes are fair and equitable for all employees. Additionally, our Reasonable Adjustments Policy guides line managers in providing support to individuals with specific needs.
Wellbeing
Valtech is dedicated to an inclusive workplace aligned with the government's good work plan, recognizing that their health and happiness are essential for our collective success. We prioritize the physical and mental health of our team members by providing access to private healthcare and the Employee Assistance Programme through our partnership app, LifeWorks.   
To further support our employees' wellbeing, we organize regular activities aimed at both physical and mental health management. These activities include initiatives such as the 5k for May charity event, resilience training sessions, virtual coffee meet-ups, mindfulness courses, meditation subscriptions, and workshops focused on mental health awareness and support. We actively participate in events like Mental Health Awareness Week to raise awareness and provide resources to our team.   
In addition to these internal initiatives, we encourage healthy habits like screen breaks and walking meetings, especially for those working remotely, to ensure our employees have opportunities to recharge and reconnect with their surroundings throughout the day.   
Valtech is a people-first company, which extends beyond our internal operations to our interactions with clients and partners. We believe in creating inclusive workplaces that prioritize health equality and provide equal opportunities for skills development and advancement.   
We extend our wellbeing initiatives to our clients and partners, offering access to the same level of support and resources whenever possible. We track our progress in promoting wellbeing through monthly team health surveys specific to each contract and report these results to our clients quarterly, providing insights and analysis on our collective efforts to prioritize employee health and happiness.   
Overall, Valtech is dedicated to creating a supportive and inclusive environment where everyone can thrive, both professionally and personally. We believe that by prioritizing wellbeing, we can build stronger, healthier, and more resilient teams that drive sustainable success for our organization and those we serve.
