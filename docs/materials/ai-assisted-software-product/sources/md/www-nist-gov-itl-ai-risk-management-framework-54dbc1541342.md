## Overview of the AI RMF 
In collaboration with the private and public sectors, NIST has developed a framework to better manage risks to individuals, organizations, and society associated with artificial intelligence (AI). The [NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AI.100-1) is intended for voluntary use and to improve the ability to incorporate trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, use, and evaluation of AI products, services, and systems.
Released on January 26, 2023, the Framework was developed through a consensus-driven, open, transparent, and collaborative process that included a Request for Information, several draft versions for public comments, multiple [workshops](https://www.nist.gov/artificial-intelligence/nist-ai-engagement "NIST AI Engagement "), and other opportunities to provide input. It is intended to build on, align with, and support AI risk management efforts by others ([Fact Sheet](https://www.nist.gov/document/about-nist-ai-rmf "About the NIST AI RMF")).
A companion [NIST AI RMF Playbook](https://airc.nist.gov/AI_RMF_Knowledge_Base/Playbook) also has been published by NIST along with an [AI RMF Roadmap](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework/roadmap-nist-artificial-intelligence-risk-management-framework-ai "Roadmap for the NIST Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework \(AI RMF 1.0\) "), [AI RMF Crosswalk](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework/crosswalks-nist-artificial-intelligence-risk-management-framework "Crosswalks to the NIST Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework \(AI RMF 1.0\) "), and various [Perspectives](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework/perspectives-about-nist-artificial-intelligence-risk-management "Perspectives about the NIST Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework").
On March 30, 2023, NIST launched the [Trustworthy and Responsible AI Resource Center](https://airc.nist.gov/Home), which will facilitate implementation of, and international alignment with, the AI RMF. Examples of how other organizations are building on and using the AI RMF can be found via the [AIRC’s Use Case page](https://airc.nist.gov/Usecases).
On July 26, 2024, NIST released [NIST-AI-_600-1, Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework: Generative Artificial Intelligence Profile_](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AI.600-1). The profile  can help organizations identify unique risks posed by generative AI and proposes actions for generative AI risk management that best aligns with their goals and priorities.
To view public comments received on the previous drafts of the AI RMF and Requests for Information, see the [AI RMF Development](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework/ai-rmf-development "https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework/ai-rmf-development") page.
