## Quick Start
Get started with KServe in minutes. Follow these simple steps to deploy your first model.
1
### Install KServe
Install KServe and its dependencies on your Kubernetes cluster:
    
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kserve/kserve/releases/download/v0.11.0/kserve.yaml  
    
2
### Create an InferenceService
Deploy a pre-trained model with a simple YAML configuration:
    
    apiVersion: "serving.kserve.io/v1beta1"  
    kind: "InferenceService"  
    metadata:  
      name: "qwen-llm"  
    spec:  
      predictor:  
        model:  
          modelFormat:  
            name: huggingface  
          storageUri: "hf://Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct"  
          resources:  
            requests:  
              cpu: "1"  
              memory: 4Gi  
              nvidia.com/gpu: "1"  
    
3
### Send Inference Requests
Make predictions using the deployed model:
    
    curl -v -H "Host: qwen-llm.default.example.com" \  
      http://localhost:8080/openai/v1/chat/completions -d @./prompt.json
