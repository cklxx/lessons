# Designing public services that work for everyone 
Posted by:  [Alasdair Hewitt, Senior Product Manager, GDS](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/author/alasdair-hewitt-senior-product-manager-gds/ "Posts by Alasdair Hewitt, Senior Product Manager, GDS"), Posted on: 10 December 2025 \- Categories:  [Digital inclusion](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/category/digital-inclusion/), [Digital, Data and Technology](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/category/digital-data-and-technology/)
At the Government Digital Service (GDS), we’ve always been passionate about delivering public services that work for _everyone_ , including people who aren’t confident online or who can’t afford or access the right technology. As part of the services pillar of the Digital Inclusion Action Plan, we’re working to remove barriers to accessing digital services by improving the standards, guidance and tools that help service teams build with inclusion in mind.  
This post shares what we’ve done so far this year, what we’ve learned, who we’ve worked with, and where we’re heading next. This post also highlights how GDS is leading the Services pillar of the Digital Inclusion Action Plan to deliver Point 1 of the [blueprint for modern digital government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-blueprint-for-modern-digital-government/a-blueprint-for-modern-digital-government-html): joining up public services to improve digital access and support the digitally excluded. 
## **What  we’re aiming for ** 
Our Inclusive Services work has three main goals:  
  * To update [the Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) and [Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) with clearer, more practical guidance based on learnings from across government service delivery. This will help teams design and deliver services that remove barriers to digital access.  


  * To develop a consistent measure of whether digital services are reaching and working for the people who need them. 


  * Build a cross-government community of practice to join up digital inclusion initiatives and share knowledge and best practice 


Together, this will help ensure public digital services are designed and built for the full diversity of users across the UK.  
## **What  we’ve done so far ** 
### **1\. Digital Inclusion Action Plan:**  
Released in February 2025, the _Digital Inclusion Action Plan:  _[_First Steps_](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-inclusion-action-plan-first-steps/digital-inclusion-action-plan-first-steps) outlines the government’s vision for improving digital inclusion across four pillars: **skills, access, services, and trust**. GDS leads the services pillar, working to ensure government services are accessible, inclusive, and easy to use. 
Digital Inclusion Action Plan. We're making sure everyone can be included in our digital world.
### **_2._ Discovery phase:** 
To inform our approach, we mapped digital inclusion initiatives in the UK and internationally. We explored what already works, where the gaps are and how others measure success. This helped us understand how services are (or are not) meeting the needs of people who are digitally excluded, and where guidance and best practice could better support teams. 
We found that many local authorities and third-sector organisations deliver effective inclusion initiatives, but challenges remain around sustainability, affordability, rural connectivity and long-term impact tracking. International examples, such as Singapore’s community-based hubs, provide useful models of strong leadership and inclusive design. 
### **3\. In-depth research sessions:**  
Building on the discovery work, we carried out a series of in-depth research sessions with government service teams tackling inclusion challenges first hand, from veterans' services to asylum seekers. These honest, reflective conversations showed what it’s like to build for inclusion in practice.  
Some clear themes emerged:  
  * The need for more _practical_ , _real-world_  blueprints and guidance, not just principles  


  * A desire for _shared language_  around digital exclusion  


  * The importance of _case studies_  that reflect complex, overlapping needs  


### **4\. Cross-government  workshops:** 
We also brought together service teams from across government for two workshops. These sessions gave designers, researchers, policy specialists, and others space to share experiences, test ideas, and explore how we can make services more inclusive. Discussions focused on practical topics such as doing inclusive user research, understanding impact and designing effective alternative pathways for those who cannot use digital channels. We’re now analysing the findings to inform the next stage of our work.  
## **Next  steps:** 
Over the coming months we’ll:  
  * Reflect what we’ve learned in refreshed Service Manual content and iteratively develop the GOV.UK Service Manual, with clearer, practical guidance to support the design and maintenance of inclusive services. 


  * Develop a shared way to measure whether services reduce digital exclusion and track progress over time. 


  * Continue building the cross-government community of practice to support collaboration and knowledge sharing 


We’re committed to building services that work for everyone and will continue to share our progress.
