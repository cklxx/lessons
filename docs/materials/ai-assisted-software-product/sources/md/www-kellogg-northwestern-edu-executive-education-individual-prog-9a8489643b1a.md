# AI-Driven Product Strategy
###  Harness AI to build product strategy that drives growth 
As artificial intelligence (AI) reshapes industries and raises customer expectations, organizations demand greater speed, improved precision and sharper decision making from their product teams. Yet, many professionals remain caught in cycles of reactive execution, fragmented alignment and process-heavy routines. Now, the role of product management calls for the ability to shape strategy, influence cross-functional teams, make decisions that drive measurable outcomes and leverage AI daily.
The eight-week AI-Driven Product Strategy online program empowers participants to lead the entire product life cycle, from vision and discovery to go-to-market (GTM) strategy and growth. It delivers an AI-forward curriculum that blends rigor with applied learning. This will help professionals strengthen their product strategy, planning and roadmapping skills to turn efforts into business outcomes.
Throughout the program, participants actively use generative AI (gen AI) tools and signature frameworks to tackle product challenges, turn insights into action and lead high-stakes conversations with confidence. By the end of the program, participants gain the strategic clarity and AI-driven confidence needed to lead product development and drive innovation.

### FAQ
**What is the learning experience?**
Your learning experience will consist of frameworks delivered via video lectures, live webinars, real world examples and case studies, application of frameworks through weekly activities, customized assignments and quizzes, discussion boards, and faculty engagement.
 
**What is the program format?**
The program consists of 8 modules delivered over 9 weeks online. Learners can expect to dedicate 4-6 hours per week to watching videos, completing assignments and participating in discussions. Modules are opened at the beginning of each week and have quizzes/assessments at the module's conclusion. Learners may choose to engage with the program module all in one sitting or in smaller segments of time throughout the week. While the modules do not close, access to assignments is closed each week.
 
**Could a learner choose to opt out of some topics?**
No. This is an online program in which a topic module is introduced each week, and the learner is expected to watch the video lectures, participate in the live webinars, complete the exercises/activities and take the mastery quiz at the end of each week to progress to the subsequent week's topic.
 
**Are any of the sessions delivered in real time (live)?**
There will be live webinars, led by faculty and/or subject matter experts, delivered during the course of the program via a video conferencing platform. These sessions provide learners with an opportunity to listen and ask questions, and while they are valuable in enhancing the overall experience, attendance is not mandatory. All live sessions are recorded for later viewing.
 
**What methods will be used for grading and evaluations?**
Kellogg program leaders will review assignments, discussions and exercises to determine participants' understanding of the material.
 
**How much time is allocated to complete assignments?**
The due date for submitting assignments is typically within 7 days of the module opening, but can be as long as 14 days, depending on the scope of the assignment. However, learners may request deadline extensions to accommodate for business and personal conflicts that may arise during the program timeframe. Reach out to the support team to discuss any challenges you may have in completing assignments.
 
**Can participation in this program be counted as credit toward a degree, either at Kellogg, Northwestern University or another academic institution?**
No. Executive Education offers only non-degree programs and each participant receives a certificate of completion at the end of the program. This certificate does not count as credit toward a degree. In addition, at this time, our online programs do not count as credit toward a Kellogg Executive Scholar Certificate.
 
**Does the program offer community engagement for learners?**
Yes, participants can create a profile, connect and collaborate with peers, and interact with academic/industry experts such as program leaders and teaching assistants. Live sessions with subject matter experts will be held during the program and all participants are welcome to join in with questions or to discuss assignments.
 
**What are the requirements for accessing the program?**
Participants will need the following to access the program:
  * Valid email address
  * Computing device connected to the internet (Mac/PC/laptop, tablet or smartphone)
  * The latest version of your preferred browser to access our learning platform (Chrome and Firefox are preferred for accessing Canvas)
  * Microsoft Office and PDF viewer to access content such as documents, spreadsheets, presentations, PDF files, and transcripts
  * Additional software and resources may be required for certain programs - this will be communicated upon registration and/or at the beginning of the program


PLEASE NOTE: Google, Vimeo and YouTube may be utilized in the program delivery
 
**Does the program offer a certificate?**
Yes. Participants will receive a digital certificate of completion from Kellogg following a successful conclusion to the program. Since this program is graded as a pass or fail, participants must receive an 80% to pass and obtain the certificate. This digital certificate can be shared with colleagues and posted on LinkedIn. (PLEASE NOTE: We do not provide reports of assessments, or "transcripts," since this is a non-degree program.)
 
**Who is Emeritus and what is their relationship with Kellogg Executive Education?**
Kellogg Executive Education is partnering with Emeritus Institute of Management, an online education provider, to develop and deliver this program. By working with Emeritus, we are able to provide broader access to Executive Education, beyond our on-campus offerings, in a collaborative and engaging format that is consistent with Kellogg's standard of quality.
