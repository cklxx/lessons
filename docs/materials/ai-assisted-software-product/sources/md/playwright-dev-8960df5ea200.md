### Any browser • Any platform • One API
**Cross-browser.** Playwright supports all modern rendering engines including Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox.
**Cross-platform.** Test on Windows, Linux, and macOS, locally or on CI, headless or headed.
**Cross-language.** Use the Playwright API in [TypeScript](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro), [JavaScript](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro), [Python](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro), [.NET](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/intro), [Java](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/intro).
**Test Mobile Web.** Native mobile emulation of Google Chrome for Android and Mobile Safari. The same rendering engine works on your Desktop and in the Cloud.
### 
### 
### Resilient • No flaky tests
**Auto-wait.** Playwright waits for elements to be actionable prior to performing actions. It also has a rich set of introspection events. The combination of the two eliminates the need for artificial timeouts - the primary cause of flaky tests.
**Web-first assertions.** Playwright assertions are created specifically for the dynamic web. Checks are automatically retried until the necessary conditions are met.
**Tracing.** Configure test retry strategy, capture execution trace, videos, screenshots to eliminate flakes.
### No trade-offs • No limits
Browsers run web content belonging to different origins in different processes. Playwright is aligned with the modern browsers architecture and runs tests out-of-process. This makes Playwright free of the typical in-process test runner limitations.
**Multiple everything.** Test scenarios that span multiple **tabs** , multiple **origins** and multiple **users**. Create scenarios with different contexts for different users and run them against your server, all in one test.
**Trusted events.** Hover elements, interact with dynamic controls, produce trusted events. Playwright uses real browser input pipeline indistinguishable from the real user.
**Test frames, pierce Shadow DOM.** Playwright selectors pierce shadow DOM and allow entering frames seamlessly.
### 
### 
### Full isolation • Fast execution
**Browser contexts.** Playwright creates a browser context for each test. Browser context is equivalent to a brand new browser profile. This delivers full test isolation with zero overhead. Creating a new browser context only takes a handful of milliseconds.
**Log in once.** Save the authentication state of the context and reuse it in all the tests. This bypasses repetitive log-in operations in each test, yet delivers full isolation of independent tests.
### Powerful Tooling
**[Codegen.](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen)** Generate tests by recording your actions. Save them into any language.
**[Playwright inspector.](https://playwright.dev/docs/debug#playwright-inspector)** Inspect page, generate selectors, step through the test execution, see click points, explore execution logs.
**[Trace Viewer.](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer-intro)** Capture all the information to investigate the test failure. Playwright trace contains test execution screencast, live DOM snapshots, action explorer, test source, and many more.
