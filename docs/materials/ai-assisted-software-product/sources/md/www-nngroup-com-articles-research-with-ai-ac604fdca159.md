Summary:  AI can speed up certain research tasks but is currently most helpful in the planning and analysis stages. 
This article focuses on how publicly available AI tools can help UX researchers in their studies. You’ll want to use your AI tools more heavily for certain stages of research projects and avoid them for others.

## How AI Can Help in Research Projects
Let’s look at the tasks where AI tools are most likely to be helpful.
## Planning Studies
This is (by far) where AI is currently most helpful for UX research.
**Type of Research Work** |  **Capability** |  **Details** |  **Watch Out For**  
---|---|---|---  
Desk research | ✅ |  Starting research and gathering sources |  Inaccurate information and made-up sources  
Ideation during planning |  ✅ |  Generating possible research goals, method options, interview or survey questions, and usability testing tasks |  Violations of best practices  
Documentation |  ✅ |  Tailoring research-related documentation for a study, including consent forms, observer instructions, notetaking instructions, and facilitation scripts |  Mistakes in filling out templates provided to the system  
### Desk Research
We don’t always need to spend our time on primary research. Often, we can find useful guidance in existing findings from inside or outside our own field. AI can function as an excellent [desk researcher](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/secondary-research-in-ux/), but with some serious limitations
AI can work as a starting point for your desk research, but not as the final source. It can assist in exploring a problem space or topic, but don’t use it as a fact-checker.
_When asked for recommended reading about diary studies, ChatGPT’s first recommended source was an NN/g article titled_[ _“Diary Studies: Understanding Long-Term User Behavior and Experiences.”_](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/diary-studies/) _While the article is real and relevant, it was written by_[ _Kim Flaherty_](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/author/kim-flaherty/) _. No Michelle Reiss Nelson has ever worked at NN/g._
#### Tips:
  * **Always ask AI systems to cite primary sources,** and then go check those sources.
  * **Use tools specifically designed for information seeking** (such as Perplexity or ScholarAI), but remember that no generative AI system will be free of [misinformation, bias, or hallucinations](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/artificial-intelligence-glossary/).


### Ideation
Planning studies requires a fair amount of ideation work — thinking up screener questions, exploring ways to set up the study, and drafting tasks. AI excels at these.
For example, while planning a diary study on [NN/g’s weekly newsletter](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/subscribe/), we asked ChatGPT to come up with different questions for study participants. 
Here’s the prompt we used.
> **_Prompt:_**
> _Generate 15 different questions I might ask in the daily respondent survey. Then, review the list, and choose the best 5–10 questions you think would serve my study goals best. Order those questions in a way that will make logical sense to my respondents._
Here are the first 4 questions from the list of 8 that ChatGPT offered.
> **_ChatGPT Response:_**
> _1\. Which UX newsletters did you receive today?_
> _Starts by setting the context and identifying other newsletters for comparison._
> _2\. Did you open the NN/g newsletter today? Why or why not?_
> _Moves into understanding the decision to engage or not with the NN/g newsletter._
> _3\. What specific elements of the NN/g newsletter caught your attention?_
> _Dives into what worked or didn’t in capturing the respondent’s attention._
> _4\. How much time did you spend reading the NN/g newsletter today?_
> _Assesses the level of engagement and time commitment._
A decent start! These questions aren’t perfect. We’ll want to remove some, rewrite others, and add new ones. But they’re enough to get us started. 
#### Tips
  * Ask your AI tool to **follow established best practices** when generating options for [tasks](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/test-tasks-quant-qualitative/) or [questions](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/interview-questions-mistakes/). If you don’t like the results, you may need to explicitly list the characteristics you want the output to have.
  * Ideally, have a **human research expert review** your final list of ideas. If you’re an expert, that could be you. If you’re new to research, contact a more experienced researcher for guidance.


### Documentation
Research planning requires some (often tedious) documentation preparation: study plans, [screeners](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/screen-your-research-participants-avoid-bias-user-research/), [consent forms](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/informed-consent/), observer instructions, and so on. AI tools can immensely speed this process up.
However, provide your AI tool with a template to start with. Remember: AI systems can’t always tell good advice from bad. Giving them a solid starting point will help them avoid mistakes.
Let’s say we’re working with ChatGPT to produce documentation for our newsletter study. After communicating important study details (like method, goals, study design, and participant details), we might upload NN/g’s standard consent-form template and provide the following prompt.
> **_Example Prompt:_**
> _Based on the study details provided above, customize a consent form for my study. Follow the format of the attached consent-form template. Do you need any additional details before you begin?_
#### Tips
  * When asking AI tools to complete research-related documentation, provide them with **a template as a starting point.**
  * **Watch out for mistakes** in how the system completes the documentation. For example, double-check that the correct data-collection permissions are outlined in your consent form.


## Conducting Research
Current AI tools have limited usefulness during moderated studies: they are not currently capable of [observing](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/observers-person-and-remote-usability-studies/), [facilitating](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/usability-test-mistakes/), or analyzing usability testing.
**Type of Research Work** |  **Capability** |  **Details** |  **Watch Out For**  
---|---|---|---  
Notetaking during interviews |  ✅ |  Meeting notetakers can document conversations in real time. |  Misunderstandings or or misattributing comments to the wrong speaker  
Conducting interviews |  ❓ |  Emerging tools (e.g., Versive) can ask custom followup questions in real time. |  Shallow insights  
Notetaking, facilitating, or analyzing usability testing |  ❌ |  AI tools can’t currently “watch” usability tests, whether live or recorded. |  Misleading claims about the AI’s abilities to run user tests or analyze behavioral data  
### Conducting Qualitative Behavioral Studies (Like User Testing)
[Behavioral data](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/attitudinal-behavioral/) is about what users do. While current AI tools are superb at processing text, they cannot understand and interpret users’ actions or nonverbal interactions with an interface.
So, **AI tools can’t observe usability testing or field studies.**
While AI systems are capable of analyzing video (text and object recognition, facial-expression interpretation, etc.), we have yet to see an AI tool that can “watch” usability tests. Beyond technical limitations, observing or facilitating a usability test requires excellent contextual awareness — something that current tools lack.
As a result, don’t expect AI tools to be capable of facilitating or even proper [notetaking](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/group-notetaking/) during usability testing. Some products market themselves as having this capacity. So far, all the tools that we’ve tested that make that claim simply analyze a usability-testing transcript — not what the user actually did in the session. That is not good enough. People often say one thing but do another.
(However, AI can help with processing usability testing data _after_ it’s been processed by a human. For example, a researcher may use an unmoderated testing tool to collect quantitative data from a usability test. That human researcher will need to check the data and video recordings to catch any problem participants. But once the data set is ready, AI can help the researcher perform [statistical](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/statistical-significance-ux/) analysis on that data.)
### Conducting Attitudinal Studies (like Interviews)
While generative AI tools can’t handle behavioral data yet, they **do much better with self-reported or**[**attitudinal data**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/attitudinal-behavioral/)**** gathered through methods like interviews, diary studies, and surveys. This is because that data is language-based.
AI systems can act as **a backup notetaker during interviews**. General-purpose meeting notetakers (like [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/)) can transcribe conversations in real time and summarize primary points of discussion. However, like every other AI tool, they aren’t perfect. These products often misunderstand the context or what’s most important, and they can get confused about who’s speaking.
Generative AI tools do have great _potential_ for conducting interviews at scale — especially [structured or semistructured interviews](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/3-types-user-interviews/), which follow a script, with some tailored followup questions. However, it’s unclear if these AI tools will be able to deliver the same level of critical [rapport building](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/building-rapport/) as a human interviewer.
At the time of writing, there are only a few tools offering real-time AI-generated interviewing. ([Versive](https://www.getversive.com/) and [Outset](https://outset.ai/) are two, though we might categorize their method as more of a [survey](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/survey-best-practices/) with custom followup questions than a real interview.)
#### Tips:
  * Consider using an AI assistant for **notetaking during interviews,** especially if you are a UX team of one.
  * However, live notetaking isn’t necessary if you’re using an analysis tool that provides **transcription**(covered in the next section).


## Analyzing Data
This section focuses on analyzing text-based data gathered from methods like interviews, surveys, and diary studies, as well as numerical data.
**Type of Research Work** |  **Capability** |  **Details** |  **Watch Out For**  
---|---|---|---  
Transcribing and summarizing interviews |  ✅ |  AI features transcribe conversation recordings with linked timestamps, and summarize key points. |  Higher error rates for some languages or accents Misunderstandings or omissions  
Cleaning and sanitizing data |  ✅ |  Tools will prepare and scrub any personally identifying information from raw data. |  Mistakes  
Preliminary coding and clustering of qualitative data |  ✅ |  AI features can take a first pass through your data looking for commonalities or rough themes. | 
  * Omissions
  * Too many items in an “other” category

  
Assisting in quantitative analysis |  ✅ |  AI can advise on the correct statistical procedures and conduct some steps in the analysis. | 
  * Mistakes
  * Oversight of statistical assumptions

  
### Timestamps and Summaries
Many researchers have been using AI-based video transcription for years. This feature seems to be improving, particularly in its ability to handle more languages and accents.
Particularly useful are the timestamps linking the transcript text to relevant moments in the video recording.
Another AI-based feature that is becoming mainstream in research tools is transcript summarization.
_Alongside an AI-generated transcript for an interview recording, Dovetail’s summary feature listed key moments along the right rail._
#### Tips:
  * **Double-check summaries:** AI-powered transcription and summarization features can misunderstand context.
  * **Watch out for missing summaries** for sections of the session or interview.


### Cleaning and Sanitizing Data
Some research-analysis tools will scrub any personally identifying information (names, email addresses, credit card numbers, etc.) from raw data, thus helping us protect participant data while reducing work during a tedious and time-consuming step of analysis — particularly for quantitative studies with large amounts of data.
These tools do make mistakes, however. For example, in one study about research tools, an AI feature removed all tool names from an interview. The system mistakenly thought it was protecting the participant’s privacy by removing the name of the company they worked for, but in reality, it removed information about which tool the participant was reviewing.
### Preliminary Coding and Clustering of Qualitative Data
If you have transcripts, AI can identify codes (or tags) for your data, by paying attention to common language used in your data set. Not all AI-generated codes will be useful to you, but they may provide **a starting point.**
_Dovetail can cluster your highlights. Unfortunately, these often need substantial editing from a human. In this example, some of the generated categories are duplicative. Additionally, most of the highlights were placed in an “other” category, here titled_ Outliers: These highlights don’t fit the groups.
If your team takes notes in a white-boarding tool like Miro, you can use AI features to cluster stickies. The accuracy of the clustering depends on the clarity of the text in the stickies.
AI-generated clusters are rarely perfect — for example, many stickies will be grouped in an “Other” category. However, having the AI take a first pass through your items can accelerate the analysis process.
#### Tips:
  * To get better results at this stage, **provide context.** Tools like Dovetail allow you to provide your research questions, which are critical for the system to return codes of any value at all.
  * Make sure your notes, stickies, or highlights are **complete enough** that the feature can make sense of them


### Assisting in Quantitative Analysis
AI tools can speed up quantitative analysis by either advising on the correct statistical procedures or by conducting steps in the analysis, including:
  * Handling missing or incomplete data records
  * Transforming or sanitizing raw data
  * Descriptive or inferential statistics
  * Rough sentiment analysis


They can even generate some decent [data-visualization charts](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/contrast-charts/) from your data.
#### Tips
  * Be sure to **thoroughly spot-check** any analysis or data processing you ask the AI to perform.
  * Ask the AI tool to follow [**data-visualization best practices**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/contrast-charts/) when creating charts.


### Limitations of AI Analysis
**Never rely on AI tools to perform all your analysis for you.** AI is stochastic — it can choose to pay attention to certain things but disregard others. That might mean it’ll focus on the wrong aspects of your data. It might miss, misinterpret, or even manufacture insights.
For [thematic analysis](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thematic-analysis/), a human perspective is needed to connect the dots in ways AI (currently) can’t. When analyzing qualitative data, a good human researcher will consider contextual questions like:
  * How does this participant’s statement contrast with what else they said?
  * What’s this person’s underlying mental model?
  * How was this data collected? Did the interviewer accidentally prime the participant?
  * Might the participant have felt embarrassed to tell the truth?
  * Was this participant not a good fit for the study’s recruitment criteria?


That level of complex, context-informed consideration is beyond the capacity of current AI tools.
#### Tips:
  * Use AI transcription, summarization, and coding features to **speed up the initial steps in your analysis process.**
  * Remember that AI systems can handle data from interviews, surveys, and diary studies, but they **can’t observe usability testing** or watch video clips like a human can.
  * Treat AI’s coding as **an initial pass.** A human still needs to make sense of the data and translate it into insights.
  * Don’t attempt to use AI analysis tools for usability testing.


## Reporting Research
**Type of Research Work** |  **Capability** |  **Details** |  **Watch Out For**  
---|---|---|---  
Drafting deliverables |  ✅ |  AI can generate elements or first drafts of deliverables like personas or journey maps. |  Made-up data or details that are not rooted in research  
Copyediting and revision |  ✅ |  AI can polish or shorten text. |  Outputs that don’t fit your audience’s communication style  
Summarizing research findings |  ✅ |  In some research repositories, AI chats can summarize findings and provide quick answers. |  Hallucinations  
AI chatbots can be helpful writing assistants for any kind of communication, including **research reports, summaries, or artifacts.** Clear communication is essential for building buy-in with stakeholders. Consider asking AI systems (such as Claude, which seems particularly good at this) to help with:
  * Grammar and copyediting
  * Tailoring communication to your specific audience
  * Adjusting tone of voice
  * Avoiding UX jargon (especially for a nonUX audience)


You can also use AI tools to get started on **deliverables** like user [personas](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/personas-study-guide/) or [journey maps](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/journey-mapping-101/) — as long as they’re based on real research.
Finally, we’re excited about the potential for AI tools to **improve the dissemination of research findings** within organizations. We’re already seeing improvements in findability in many [research-repository](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/research-repositories/) tools, as well as in general-purpose knowledge tools like Notion.
_Notion’s AI chatbot can answer questions about research findings stored in its workspaces._
Rather than having to search a research repository only by keywords and then sift through a collection of tags, clips, or highlighted notes, your stakeholders can ask questions. AI tools can search your data, synthesize it, and curate a response that answers a particular question. (This is a case where [an AI chatbot is actually a good solution.](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-chat-not-the-answer/))
These features can support better adoption, but teams may still need to reach out to researchers for a thorough explanation of what the research means, what its limitations are, and whether further research is needed.
## AI Can’t Do Your Job for You
If you want to produce high-quality outputs, don’t expect to be able to have AI tools do your work for you. Human oversight, guidance, and review are still critical.
Current AI tools have many limitations.[ Like interns,](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-intern/) they work best when you provide ample instructions, context, constraints, and corrections.
Despite the annoying need to double-check the output of AI systems, these tools still have the potential to accelerate your UX-research workflows. They are becoming increasingly important in a world where researchers often struggle to keep up with fast-paced work environments.
