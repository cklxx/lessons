### Clustered bar chart
You can use this type of chart for comparing a small number of series across several categories.Â   
  
A clustered bar chart uses side-by-side bars of different colours to show values for different series within categories.  
  
For further guidance on how to use and implement these charts, please see the [Clustered bar chart](https://service-manual.ons.gov.uk/data-visualisation/chart-types/clustered-bar-chart) in the Data visualisation section.

### Stacked bar chart
A stacked bar chart uses different colour segments within each bar to show a breakdown of categories.
For further guidance on how to use and implement these charts, please see the [Stacked bar charts](https://service-manual.ons.gov.uk/data-visualisation/chart-types/stacked-bar-charts) page in the Data visualisation section.Â
