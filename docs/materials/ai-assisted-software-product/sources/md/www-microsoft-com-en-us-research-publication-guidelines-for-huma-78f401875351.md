Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) frame opportunities and challenges for user interface design. Principles for human-AI interaction have been discussed in the human-computer interaction community for over two decades, but more study and innovation are needed in light of advances in AI and the growing uses of AI technologies in human-facing applications. We propose 18 generally applicable design guidelines for human-AI interaction. These guidelines are validated through multiple rounds of evaluation including a user study with 49 design practitioners who tested the guidelines against 20 popular AI-infused products. The results verify the relevance of the guidelines over a spectrum of interaction scenarios and reveal gaps in our knowledge, highlighting opportunities for further research. Based on the evaluations, we believe the set of design guidelines can serve as a resource to practitioners working on the design of applications and features that harness AI technologies, and to researchers interested in the further development of guidelines for human-AI interaction design.

##  [Create human-centered AI with the Human-AI eXperience (HAX) Toolkit webinar](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/create-human-centered-ai-with-the-human-ai-experience-hax-toolkit-webinar/)
The tech industry is being called upon to develop and deploy AI technologies more responsibly. Yet many organizations that create AI technologies report being unprepared to address AI risks and failures.
To meet these challenges, Microsoft is striving to take a human-centered approach to AI, designing and building technologies that benefit people and society while also mitigating potential harms. This includes understanding human needs and using that insight to drive development decisions from beginning to end.
To assist AI practitioners in building human-centered AI, we are introducing the Human-AI eXperience (HAX) Toolkit, launching on July 19. This suite of tools spans the end-to-end product development lifecycle, providing support where AI practitioners have requested it.
In this webinar, join Saleema Amershi, Senior Principal Research Manager, and Mihaela Vorvoreanu, Aether Director of UX Research and RAI education, to learn how and when to use each tool in the HAX Toolkit to create human-centered AI.
Together, you’ll explore:
  * Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction – best practices for how AI systems should behave during user interactions that synthesize more than 20 years of guidance on this topic
  * The HAX Workbook – a tool to guide teams through planning and implementing human-AI interaction best practices
  * The HAX Design Patterns – a set of flexible solutions to recurring human-AI interaction problems
  * The HAX Playbook – an interactive tool for generating scenarios to test based on likely human-AI interaction failures
