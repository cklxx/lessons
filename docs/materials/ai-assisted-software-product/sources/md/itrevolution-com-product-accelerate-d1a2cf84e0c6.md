Winner of the Shingo Publication Award
How can we apply technology to drive business value? For years, we’ve been told that the performance of software delivery teams doesn’t matter―that it can’t provide a competitive advantage to our companies. Through four years of groundbreaking research to include data collected from the State of DevOps reports conducted with Puppet, Dr. Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim set out to find a way to measure software delivery performance―and what drives it―using rigorous statistical methods. This book presents both the findings and the science behind that research, making the information accessible for readers to apply in their own organizations.

####  "Excellent! As well as conclusively showing that DevOps outcomes are faster, cheaper AND safer, this book is an excellent case study for robust survey design and analysis."
#####  Adrian Cockcroft
VP Amazon Sustainability Architecture, Amazon
####  "This is the kind of foresight that CEOs, CFOs, and CIOs desperately need if their company is going to survive in this new software-centric world. Anyone that doesn’t read this book will be replaced by someone that has. Anyone that doesn’t read this book will be replaced by someone that has."
#####  Thomas Limoncelli
Co-Author of The Practice of Cloud System Administration
####  "Accelerate summarizes the best metrics, practices, and principles to use for improving software delivery and digital product performance, based on years of well-documented research. We strongly recommend this book to anyone involved in a digital transformation for solid guidance about what works, what doesn’t work, and what doesn’t matter."
#####  Tom Poppendieck & Mary Poppendieck
Authors of the Lean Software Development Series of Books
####  "Whether they recognize it or not, most organizations today are in the business of software development in one way, shape, or form. And most are being dragged down by slow lead times, buggy output, and complicated features that add expense and frustrate users. It doesn’t need to be this way. Forsgren, Humble and Kim shine a compelling light on the what, why, and how of DevOps so you, too, can experience what outstanding looks and feels like."
