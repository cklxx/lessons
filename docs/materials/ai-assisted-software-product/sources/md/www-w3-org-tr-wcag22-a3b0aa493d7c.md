## Abstract
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 covers a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on any kind of device (including desktops, laptops, kiosks, and mobile devices). Following these guidelines will also often make web content more usable to users in general.
WCAG 2.2 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying the success criteria in specific technologies, as well as general information about interpreting the success criteria, is provided in separate documents. See [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) for an introduction and links to WCAG technical and educational material.
WCAG 2.2 extends [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) [[WCAG21](#bib-wcag21 "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) 2.1")], which was published as a W3C Recommendation June 2018. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 also conforms to WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1. The WG intends that for policies requiring conformance to WCAG 2.0 or WCAG 2.1, WCAG 2.2 can provide an alternate means of conformance. The publication of WCAG 2.2 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.0 or WCAG 2.1. While WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 remain W3C Recommendations, the W3C advises the use of WCAG 2.2 to maximize future applicability of accessibility efforts. The W3C also encourages use of the most current version of WCAG when developing or updating web accessibility policies.

## Introduction
[](#intro)
 _This section is non-normative._
### Background on WCAG 2
[](#background-on-wcag-2)
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 defines how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability. These guidelines also make web content more usable by older individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general.
WCAG 2.2 is developed through the [W3C process](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/w3c-process/) in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. WCAG 2.2 builds on WCAG 2.0 [[WCAG20](#bib-wcag20 "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) 2.0")] and WCAG 2.1 [[WCAG21](#bib-wcag21 "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) 2.1")], which in turn built on WCAG 1.0 [[WAI-WEBCONTENT](#bib-wai-webcontent "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0")] and is designed to apply broadly to different web technologies now and in the future, and to be testable with a combination of automated testing and human evaluation. For an introduction to WCAG, see the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).
Significant challenges were encountered in defining additional criteria to address cognitive, language, and learning disabilities, including a short timeline for development as well as challenges in reaching consensus on testability, implementability, and international considerations of proposals. Work will carry on in this area in future versions of WCAG. We encourage authors to refer to our supplemental guidance on [improving inclusion for people with disabilities, including learning and cognitive disabilities, people with low-vision, and more](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/#supplement).
Web accessibility depends not only on accessible content but also on accessible web browsers and other user agents. Authoring tools also have an important role in web accessibility. For an overview of how these components of web development and interaction work together, see:
  * **[Essential Components of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/components/)**
  * **[User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/uaag/)**
  * **[Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/)**


Where this document refers to "WCAG 2" it is intended to mean any and all versions of WCAG that start with 2.
### WCAG 2 Layers of Guidance
[](#wcag-2-layers-of-guidance)
The individuals and organizations that use WCAG vary widely and include web designers and developers, policy makers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. In order to meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance are provided including overall _principles_ , general _guidelines_ , testable _success criteria_ and a rich collection of _sufficient techniques_ , _advisory techniques_ , and _documented common failures_ with examples, resource links and code.
  * **Principles** \- At the top are four principles that provide the foundation for web accessibility: _perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust_. See also [Understanding the Four Principles of Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility).
  * **Guidelines** \- Under the principles are guidelines. The 13 guidelines provide the basic goals that authors should work toward in order to make content more accessible to users with different disabilities. The guidelines are not testable, but provide the framework and overall objectives to help authors understand the success criteria and better implement the techniques.
  * **Success Criteria** \- For each guideline, testable success criteria are provided to allow WCAG 2.2 to be used where requirements and conformance testing are necessary such as in design specification, purchasing, regulation, and contractual agreements. In order to meet the needs of different groups and different situations, three levels of conformance are defined: A (lowest), AA, and AAA (highest). Additional information on WCAG levels can be found in [Understanding Levels of Conformance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#levels).
  * **Sufficient and Advisory Techniques** \- For each of the _guidelines_ and _success criteria_ in the WCAG 2.2 document itself, the working group has also documented a wide variety of _techniques_. The techniques are informative and fall into two categories: those that are _sufficient_ for meeting the success criteria and those that are _advisory_. The advisory techniques go beyond what is required by the individual success criteria and allow authors to better address the guidelines. Some advisory techniques address accessibility barriers that are not covered by the testable success criteria. Where common failures are known, these are also documented. See also [Sufficient and Advisory Techniques in Understanding WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/understanding-techniques).


All of these layers of guidance (principles, guidelines, success criteria, and sufficient and advisory techniques) work together to provide guidance on how to make content more accessible. Authors are encouraged to view and apply all layers that they are able to, including the advisory techniques, in order to best address the needs of the widest possible range of users.
Note that even content that conforms at the highest level (AAA) will not be accessible to individuals with all types, degrees, or combinations of disability, particularly in the cognitive, language, and learning areas. Authors are encouraged to consider the full range of techniques, including the advisory techniques, [Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities](https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/), as well as to seek relevant advice about current best practice to ensure that web content is accessible, as far as possible, to this community. [Metadata](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/understanding-metadata) may assist users in finding content most suitable for their needs. 
### WCAG 2.2 Supporting Documents
[](#wcag-2-2-supporting-documents)
The WCAG 2.2 document is designed to meet the needs of those who need a stable, referenceable technical standard. Other documents, called supporting documents, are based on the WCAG 2.2 document and address other important purposes, including the ability to be updated to describe how WCAG would be applied with new technologies. Supporting documents include: 
  1. **[How to Meet WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/)** \- A customizable quick reference to WCAG 2.2 that includes all of the guidelines, success criteria, and techniques for authors to use as they are developing and evaluating web content. This includes content from WCAG 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2, and can be filtered in many ways to help authors focus on relevant content.
  2. **[Understanding WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/)** \- A guide to understanding and implementing WCAG 2.2. There is a short "Understanding" document for each guideline and success criterion in WCAG 2.2 as well as key topics.
  3. **[Techniques for WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/)** \- A collection of techniques and common failures, each in a separate document that includes a description, examples, code and tests.
  4. **[The WCAG 2 Documents](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/docs/)** \- A brief introduction to the WCAG 2 supporting documents and supplemental guidance.
  5. **[What's New in WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/)** introduces the new success criteria with persona quotes that illustrate the accessibility issues. 


See [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) for a description of the WCAG 2.2 supporting material, including education resources related to WCAG 2. Additional resources covering topics such as the business case for web accessibility, planning implementation to improve the accessibility of websites, and accessibility policies are listed in [WAI Resources](https://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/Overview).
### Requirements for WCAG 2.2
[](#requirements-for-wcag-2-2)
WCAG 2.2 meets a set of [requirements for WCAG 2.2](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/requirements/22/) which, in turn, inherit requirements from previous WCAG 2 versions. Requirements structure the overall framework of guidelines and ensure backwards compatibility. The Working Group also used a less formal set of acceptance criteria for success criteria, to help ensure success criteria are similar in style and quality to those in WCAG 2.0. These requirements constrained what could be included in WCAG 2.2. This constraint was important to preserve its nature as a dot-release of WCAG 2.
### Comparison with WCAG 2.1
[](#comparison-with-wcag-2-1)
WCAG 2.2 was initiated with the goal to continue the work of WCAG 2.1: Improving accessibility guidance for three major groups: users with cognitive or learning disabilities, users with low vision, and users with disabilities on mobile devices. Many ways to meet these needs were proposed and evaluated, and a set of these were refined by the Working Group. Structural requirements inherited from WCAG 2.0, clarity and impact of proposals, and timeline led to the final set of success criteria included in this version. The Working Group considers that WCAG 2.2 incrementally advances web content accessibility guidance for all these areas, but underscores that not all user needs are met by these guidelines.
WCAG 2.2 builds on and is backwards compatible with WCAG 2.1, meaning web pages that conform to WCAG 2.2 are at least as accessible as pages that conform to WCAG 2.1. Requirements have been added that build on 2.1 and 2.0. WCAG 2.2 has removed one success criterion, [4.1.1 Parsing](#parsing). Authors that are required by policy to conform with WCAG 2.0 or 2.1 will be able to update content to WCAG 2.2, but may need to continue to test and report 4.1.1. Authors following more than one version of the guidelines should be aware of the following additions.
#### New Features in WCAG 2.2
[](#new-features-in-wcag-2-2)
WCAG 2.2 extends WCAG 2.1 by adding new success criteria, definitions to support them, and guidelines to organize the additions. This additive approach helps to make it clear that sites which conform to WCAG 2.2 also conform to WCAG 2.1. The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group recommends that sites adopt WCAG 2.2 as their new conformance target, even if formal obligations mention previous versions, to provide improved accessibility and to anticipate future policy changes.
The following success criteria are new in WCAG 2.2:
  * 2.4.11 [Focus Not Obscured (Minimum)](#focus-not-obscured-minimum) (AA)
  * 2.4.12 [Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced)](#focus-not-obscured-enhanced) (AAA)
  * 2.4.13 [Focus Appearance](#focus-appearance) (AAA)
  * 2.5.7 [Dragging Movements](#dragging-movements) (AA)
  * 2.5.8 [Target Size (Minimum)](#target-size-minimum) (AA)
  * 3.2.6 [Consistent Help](#consistent-help) (A)
  * 3.3.7 [Redundant Entry](#redundant-entry) (A)
  * 3.3.8 [Accessible Authentication (Minimum)](#accessible-authentication-minimum) (AA)
  * 3.3.9 [Accessible Authentication (Enhanced)](#accessible-authentication-enhanced) (AAA)


The new success criteria may reference new terms that have also been added to the glossary and form part of the normative requirements of the success criteria.
WCAG 2.2 also introduces new sections detailing aspects of the specification which may impact [privacy](#privacy-summary) and [security](#security-summary).
#### Numbering in WCAG 2.2
[](#numbering-in-wcag-2-2)
In order to avoid confusion for implementers for whom backwards compatibility to WCAG 2 versions is important, new success criteria in WCAG 2.2 have been appended to the end of the set of success criteria within their guideline. This avoids the need to change the section number of success criteria from WCAG 2, which would be caused by inserting new success criteria between existing success criteria in the guideline, but it means success criteria in each guideline are no longer grouped by conformance level. The order of success criteria within each guideline does not imply information about conformance level; only the conformance level indicator (A / AA / AAA) on the success criterion itself indicates this. The [WCAG 2.2 Quick Reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/) will provide a way to view success criteria grouped by conformance level, along with many other filter and sort options.
#### Conformance to WCAG 2.2
[](#conformance-to-wcag-2-2)
WCAG 2.2 uses the same conformance model as WCAG 2.0. It is intended that sites that conform to WCAG 2.2 also conform to WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1, which means they meet the requirements of any policies that reference WCAG 2.0 or WCAG 2.1, while also better meeting the needs of users on the current Web. 
### Later Versions of Accessibility Guidelines
[](#later-versions-of-accessibility-guidelines)
In parallel with WCAG 2.2, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is developing another major version of accessibility guidelines. The result of this work is expected to be a more substantial restructuring of web accessibility guidance than would be realistic for dot-releases of WCAG 2. The work follows a research-focused, user-centered design methodology to produce the most effective and flexible outcome, including the roles of content authoring, user agent support, and authoring tool support. This is a multi-year effort, so WCAG 2.2 is needed as an interim measure to provide updated web accessibility guidance to reflect changes on the web since the publication of WCAG 2.0. The Working Group might also develop additional interim versions, continuing with WCAG 2.2, on a similar short timeline to provide additional support while the major version is completed. 
## 1\.  Perceivable 
[](#perceivable)
Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
### Guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives

[How to Meet Text Alternatives](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#text-alternatives)
Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
#### Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content
[](#non-text-content)
[Understanding Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-content.html) |   
[How to Meet Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#non-text-content)
(Level A)
All [non-text content](#dfn-non-text-content "any content that is not a sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined or where the sequence is not expressing something in human language") that is presented to the user has a [text alternative](#dfn-text-alternative "Text that is programmatically associated with non-text content or referred to from text that is programmatically associated with non-text content. Programmatically associated text is text whose location can be programmatically determined from the non-text content.") that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below. 
Controls, Input
    
If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a [name](#dfn-name "text by which software can identify a component within web content to the user") that describes its purpose. (Refer to [Success Criterion 4.1.2](#name-role-value) for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.) 
Time-Based Media
    
If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. (Refer to [Guideline 1.2](#time-based-media) for additional requirements for media.) 
Test
    
If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in [text](#dfn-text "sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined, where the sequence is expressing something in human language"), then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. 
Sensory
    
If non-text content is primarily intended to create a [specific sensory experience](#dfn-specific-sensory-experience "a sensory experience that is not purely decorative and does not primarily convey important information or perform a function"), then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. 
[CAPTCHA](#dfn-captcha "initialism for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart"")
    
If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities. 
Decoration, Formatting, Invisible
    
If non-text content is [pure decoration](#dfn-pure-decoration "serving only an aesthetic purpose, providing no information, and having no functionality"), is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by [assistive technology](#dfn-assistive-technologies "hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents").

[How to Meet Low or No Background Audio](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#low-or-no-background-audio)
(Level AAA)
For [prerecorded](#dfn-prerecorded "information that is not live") [audio-only](#dfn-audio-only "a time-based presentation that contains only audio \(no video and no interaction\)") content that (1) contains primarily speech in the foreground, (2) is not an audio [CAPTCHA](#dfn-captcha "initialism for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart"") or audio logo, and (3) is not vocalization intended to be primarily musical expression such as singing or rapping, at least one of the following is true: 
No Background
    
The audio does not contain background sounds.
Turn Off
    
The background sounds can be turned off.
20 dB
    
The background sounds are at least 20 decibels lower than the foreground speech content, with the exception of occasional sounds that last for only one or two seconds. 
Note
Per the definition of "decibel," background sound that meets this requirement will be approximately four times quieter than the foreground speech content. 
#### Success Criterion 1.4.8 Visual Presentation
[](#visual-presentation)
[Understanding Visual Presentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/visual-presentation.html) |   
[How to Meet Visual Presentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#visual-presentation)
(Level AAA)
For the visual presentation of [blocks of text](#dfn-blocks-of-text "more than one sentence of text"), a [mechanism](#dfn-mechanism "process or technique for achieving a result") is available to achieve the following: 
  * Foreground and background colors can be selected by the user.
  * Width is no more than 80 characters or glyphs (40 if CJK).
  * Text is not justified (aligned to both the left and the right margins).
  * Line spacing (leading) is at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs, and paragraph spacing is at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing.
  * Text can be resized without [assistive technology](#dfn-assistive-technologies "hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents") up to 200 percent in a way that does not require the user to scroll horizontally to read a line of text [on a full-screen window](#dfn-on-a-full-screen-window "on the most common sized desktop/laptop display with the viewport maximized").


Note 1
Content is not required to use these values. The requirement is that a mechanism is available for users to change these presentation aspects. The mechanism can be provided by the browser or other user agent. Content is not required to provide the mechanism.
Note 2
Writing systems for some languages use different presentation aspects to improve readability and legibility. If a presentation aspect in this success criterion is not used in a writing system, content in that writing system does not need to use that presentation setting and can conform without it. Authors are encouraged to follow guidance for improving readability and legibility of text in their writing system.
#### Success Criterion 1.4.9 Images of Text (No Exception)

(Level AAA)
[Images of text](#dfn-images-of-text "text that has been rendered in a non-text form \(e.g., an image\) in order to achieve a particular visual effect") are only used for [pure decoration](#dfn-pure-decoration "serving only an aesthetic purpose, providing no information, and having no functionality") or where a particular presentation of [text](#dfn-text "sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined, where the sequence is expressing something in human language") is [essential](#dfn-essential "if removed, would fundamentally change the information or functionality of the content, and information and functionality cannot be achieved in another way that would conform") to the information being conveyed. 
Note
Logotypes (text that is part of a logo or brand name) are considered essential.

[How to Meet Reflow](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#reflow)
(Level AA)
Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:
  * Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 [CSS pixels](#dfn-css-pixels "visual angle of about 0.0213 degrees");
  * Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 [CSS pixels](#dfn-css-pixels "visual angle of about 0.0213 degrees").


Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.
Note 1
320 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting [viewport](#dfn-viewport "object in which the user agent presents content") width of 1280 CSS pixels wide at 400% zoom. For web content which is designed to scroll horizontally (e.g., with vertical text), 256 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport height of 1024 CSS pixels at 400% zoom.
Note 2
Examples of content which requires two-dimensional layout are images required for understanding (such as maps and diagrams), video, games, presentations, data tables (not individual cells), and interfaces where it is necessary to keep toolbars in view while manipulating content. It is acceptable to provide two-dimensional scrolling for such parts of the content.
#### Success Criterion 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast

The visual [presentation](#dfn-presentation "rendering of the content in a form to be perceived by users") of the following have a [contrast ratio](#dfn-contrast-ratio "\(L1 + 0.05\) / \(L2 + 0.05\), where") of at least 3:1 against adjacent color(s):
User Interface Components
    Visual information required to identify [user interface components](#dfn-user-interface-components "a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function") and [states](#dfn-states "dynamic property expressing characteristics of a user interface component that may change in response to user action or automated processes"), except for inactive components or where the appearance of the component is determined by the [user agent](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users") and not modified by the author;
Graphical Objects
    Parts of graphics required to understand the content, except when a particular presentation of graphics is [essential](#dfn-essential "if removed, would fundamentally change the information or functionality of the content, and information and functionality cannot be achieved in another way that would conform") to the information being conveyed.
#### Success Criterion 1.4.12 Text Spacing
[](#text-spacing)

[How to Meet Text Spacing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#text-spacing)
(Level AA)
In content implemented using markup languages that support the following [text](#dfn-text "sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined, where the sequence is expressing something in human language") [style properties](#dfn-style-properties "property whose value determines the presentation \(e.g. font, color, size, location, padding, volume, synthesized speech prosody\) of content elements as they are rendered \(e.g. onscreen, via loudspeaker, via braille display\) by user agents"), no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by changing no other style property:
  * Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size;
  * Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size;
  * Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size;
  * Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.


Exception: [Human languages](#dfn-human-language-s "language that is spoken, written or signed \(through visual or tactile means\) to communicate with humans") and scripts that do not make use of one or more of these text style properties in written text can conform using only the properties that exist for that combination of language and script.
Note 1
Content is not required to use these text spacing values. The requirement is to ensure that when a user overrides the authored text spacing, content or functionality is not lost.
Note 2
Writing systems for some languages use different text spacing settings, such as paragraph start indent. Authors are encouraged to follow locally available guidance for improving readability and legibility of text in their writing system.
#### Success Criterion 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus
[](#content-on-hover-or-focus)
[Understanding Content on Hover or Focus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/content-on-hover-or-focus.html) |   
[How to Meet Content on Hover or Focus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#content-on-hover-or-focus)
(Level AA)
Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true:
Dismissible
    A [mechanism](#dfn-mechanism "process or technique for achieving a result") is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an [input error](#dfn-input-error "information provided by the user that is not accepted") or does not obscure or replace other content;
Hoverable
    If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing;
Persistent
    The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid.
Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the [user agent](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users") and is not modified by the author.
Note 1
Examples of additional content controlled by the user agent include browser tooltips created through use of the HTML [`title` attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-title-attribute) [[HTML](#bib-html "HTML Standard")].
Note 2
Custom tooltips, sub-menus, and other nonmodal popups that display on hover and focus are examples of additional content covered by this criterion.
Note 3
This criterion applies to content that appears in addition to the triggering component itself. Since hidden components that are made visible on keyboard focus (such as links used to skip to another part of a page) do not present additional content they are not covered by this criterion.
## 2\. Operable 
[](#operable)
User interface components and navigation must be operable.

[How to Meet Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#keyboard)
(Level A)
All [functionality](#dfn-functionality "processes and outcomes achievable through user action") of the content is operable through a [keyboard interface](#dfn-keyboard-interface "interface used by software to obtain keystroke input") without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints. 
Note 1
This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example, if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent input but the underlying function (text input) does not. 
Note 2
This does not forbid and should not discourage providing mouse input or other input methods in addition to keyboard operation.

(Level A)
If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a [keyboard interface](#dfn-keyboard-interface "interface used by software to obtain keystroke input"), then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away. 
Note
Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See [Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference](#cc5).

(Level A)
If a [keyboard shortcut](#dfn-keyboard-shortcuts "alternative means of triggering an action by the pressing of one or more keys") is implemented in content using only letter (including upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters, then at least one of the following is true:
Turn off
    A [mechanism](#dfn-mechanism "process or technique for achieving a result") is available to turn the shortcut off;
Remap
    A mechanism is available to remap the shortcut to include one or more non-printable keyboard keys (e.g., Ctrl, Alt);
Active only on focus
    The keyboard shortcut for a [user interface component](#dfn-user-interface-components "a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function") is only active when that component has focus.

[How to Meet Timing Adjustable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#timing-adjustable)
(Level A)
For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is true:
Turn off
    
The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or
Adjust
    
The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or 
Extend
    
The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, "press the space bar"), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or 
Real-time Exception
    
The time limit is a required part of a [real-time event](#dfn-real-time-events "event that a\) occurs at the same time as the viewing and b\) is not completely generated by the content") (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or 
Essential Exception
    
The time limit is [essential](#dfn-essential "if removed, would fundamentally change the information or functionality of the content, and information and functionality cannot be achieved in another way that would conform") and extending it would invalidate the activity; or 
20 Hour Exception
    
The time limit is longer than 20 hours.
Note
This success criterion helps ensure that users can complete tasks without unexpected changes in content or context that are a result of a time limit. This success criterion should be considered in conjunction with [Success Criterion 3.2.1](#on-focus), which puts limits on changes of content or context as a result of user action.

For moving, [blinking](#dfn-blinking "switch back and forth between two visual states in a way that is meant to draw attention"), scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of the following are true: 
Moving, blinking, scrolling
    
For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a [mechanism](#dfn-mechanism "process or technique for achieving a result") for the user to [pause](#dfn-pause "stopped by user request and not resumed until requested by user"), stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity where it is [essential](#dfn-essential "if removed, would fundamentally change the information or functionality of the content, and information and functionality cannot be achieved in another way that would conform"); and 
Auto-updating
    
For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part of an activity where it is essential. 
Note 1
For requirements related to flickering or flashing content, refer to [Guideline 2.3](#seizures-and-physical-reactions). 
Note 2
Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See [Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference](#cc5). 
Note 3
Content that is updated periodically by software or that is streamed to the user agent is not required to preserve or present information that is generated or received between the initiation of the pause and resuming presentation, as this may not be technically possible, and in many situations could be misleading to do so. 
Note 4
An animation that occurs as part of a preload phase or similar situation can be considered essential if interaction cannot occur during that phase for all users and if not indicating progress could confuse users or cause them to think that content was frozen or broken.

Exceptions:
  * The focus indicator is determined by the [user agent](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users") and cannot be adjusted by the author, or
  * The focus indicator and the indicator's background color are not modified by the author.


Note 1
What is perceived as the user interface component or sub-component (to determine the perimeter) depends on its visual [presentation](#dfn-presentation "rendering of the content in a form to be perceived by users"). The visual presentation includes the component's visible [content](#dfn-content "information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a user agent, including code or markup that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions"), border, and component-specific background. It does not include shadow and glow effects outside the component's content, background, or border.
Note 2
Examples of sub-components that may receive a focus indicator are menu items in an opened drop-down menu, or focusable cells in a grid.
Note 3
Contrast calculations can be based on colors defined within the [technology](#dfn-technologies "mechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents") (such as HTML, CSS, and SVG). Pixels modified by user agent resolution enhancements and anti-aliasing can be ignored.

This criterion was originally adopted to address problems that assistive technology had directly parsing HTML. Assistive technology no longer has any need to directly parse HTML. Consequently, these problems either no longer exist or are addressed by other criteria. This criterion no longer has utility and is removed.

## 5\. Conformance
[](#conformance)
This section lists requirements for [conformance](#dfn-conform "satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification") to WCAG 2.2. It also gives information about how to make conformance claims, which are optional. Finally, it describes what it means to be [accessibility supported](#dfn-accessibility-supported "supported by users' assistive technologies as well as the accessibility features in browsers and other user agents"), since only accessibility-supported ways of using technologies can be [relied upon](#dfn-relied-upon "the content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported") for conformance. [Understanding Conformance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance) includes further explanation of the accessibility-supported concept.
### 5.1 Interpreting Normative Requirements
[](#interpreting-normative-requirements)
The main content of WCAG 2.2 is [normative](#dfn-normative "required for conformance") and defines requirements that impact conformance claims. Introductory material, appendices, sections marked as "non-normative", diagrams, examples, and notes are [informative](#dfn-informative "for information purposes and not required for conformance") (non-normative). Non-normative material provides advisory information to help interpret the guidelines but does not create requirements that impact a conformance claim.
The key words _MAY_ , _MUST_ , _MUST NOT_ , _NOT RECOMMENDED_ , _RECOMMENDED_ , _SHOULD_ , and _SHOULD NOT_ are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119](#bib-rfc2119 "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels")].
### 5.2 Conformance Requirements
[](#conformance-reqs)
In order for a web page to conform to WCAG 2.2, all of the following conformance requirements must be satisfied:
#### 5.2.1 Conformance Level
[](#cc1)
One of the following levels of conformance is met in full.
  * For Level A conformance (the minimum level of conformance), the [web page](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent") [satisfies](#dfn-satisfies "the success criterion does not evaluate to 'false' when applied to the page") all the Level A success criteria, or a [conforming alternate version](#dfn-conforming-alternate-versions "version that") is provided.
  * For Level AA conformance, the web page satisfies all the Level A and Level AA success criteria, or a Level AA conforming alternate version is provided.
  * For Level AAA conformance, the web page satisfies all the Level A, Level AA and Level AAA success criteria, or a Level AAA conforming alternate version is provided.


Note 1
Although conformance can only be achieved at the stated levels, authors are encouraged to report (in their claim) any progress toward meeting success criteria from all levels beyond the achieved level of conformance.
Note 2
It is not recommended that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA success criteria for some content.
#### 5.2.2 Full pages
[](#cc2)
[Conformance](#dfn-conform "satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification") (and conformance level) is for full [web page(s)](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent") only, and cannot be achieved if part of a web page is excluded.
Note 1
For the purpose of determining conformance, alternatives to part of a page's content are considered part of the page when the alternatives can be obtained directly from the page, e.g., a long description or an alternative presentation of a video.
Note 2
Authors of web pages that cannot conform due to content outside of the author's control may consider a [Statement of Partial Conformance](#conformance-partial).
Note 3
A full page includes each variation of the page that is automatically presented by the page for various screen sizes (e.g. variations in a responsive web page). Each of these variations needs to conform (or needs to have a conforming alternate version) in order for the entire page to conform.
#### 5.2.3 Complete processes
[](#cc3)
When a [web page](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent") is one of a series of web pages presenting a [process](#dfn-processes "series of user actions where each action is required in order to complete an activity") (i.e., a sequence of steps that need to be completed in order to accomplish an activity), all web pages in the process conform at the specified level or better. (Conformance is not possible at a particular level if any page in the process does not conform at that level or better.)
Example
An online store has a series of pages that are used to select and purchase products. All pages in the series from start to finish (checkout) conform in order for any page that is part of the process to conform.
#### 5.2.4 Only Accessibility-Supported Ways of Using Technologies
[](#cc4)
Only [accessibility-supported](#dfn-accessibility-supported "supported by users' assistive technologies as well as the accessibility features in browsers and other user agents") ways of using [technologies](#dfn-technologies "mechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents") are [relied upon](#dfn-relied-upon "the content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported") to satisfy the success criteria. Any information or functionality that is provided in a way that is not accessibility supported is also available in a way that is accessibility supported. (See [Understanding accessibility support](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#accessibility-support).)
#### 5.2.5 Non-Interference
[](#cc5)
If [ technologies ](#dfn-technologies "mechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents") are used in a way that is not [accessibility supported](#dfn-accessibility-supported "supported by users' assistive technologies as well as the accessibility features in browsers and other user agents"), or if they are used in a non-conforming way, then they do not block the ability of users to access the rest of the page. In addition, the [web page](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent") as a whole continues to meet the conformance requirements under each of the following conditions:
  1. when any technology that is not [relied upon](#dfn-relied-upon "the content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported") is turned on in a user agent,
  2. when any technology that is not relied upon is turned off in a user agent, and
  3. when any technology that is not relied upon is not supported by a user agent


In addition, the following success criteria apply to all content on the page, including content that is not otherwise relied upon to meet conformance, because failure to meet them could interfere with any use of the page:
  * **1.4.2 - Audio Control** ,
  * **2.1.2 - No Keyboard Trap** ,
  * **2.3.1 - Three Flashes or Below Threshold** , and
  * **2.2.2 - Pause, Stop, Hide**.


Note
If a page cannot conform (for example, a conformance test page or an example page), it cannot be included in the scope of conformance or in a conformance claim.
For more information, including examples, see [Understanding Conformance Requirements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#conformance-requirements).
### 5.3 Conformance Claims (Optional) 
[](#conformance-claims)
Conformance is defined only for [web pages](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent"). However, a conformance claim may be made to cover one page, a series of pages, or multiple related web pages.
#### 5.3.1 Required Components of a Conformance Claim
[](#conformance-required)
Conformance claims are **not required**. Authors can conform to WCAG 2.2 without making a claim. However, if a conformance claim is made, then the conformance claim **must** include the following information:
  1. **Date** of the claim
  2. **Guidelines title, version and URI** "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2 at <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/>"
  3. **Conformance level** satisfied: (Level A, AA or AAA)
  4. **A concise description of the web pages** , such as a list of URIs for which the claim is made, including whether subdomains are included in the claim.
Note 1
The web pages may be described by list or by an expression that describes all of the URIs included in the claim.
Note 2
Web-based products that do not have a URI prior to installation on the customer's website may have a statement that the product would conform when installed.
  5. A list of the **[web content technologies](#dfn-technologies "mechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents") [relied upon](#dfn-relied-upon "the content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported")**.


Note 3
If a conformance logo is used, it would constitute a claim and must be accompanied by the required components of a conformance claim listed above.
#### 5.3.2 Optional Components of a Conformance Claim 
[](#conformance-optional)
In addition to the required components of a conformance claim above, consider providing additional information to assist users. Recommended additional information includes:
  * A list of success criteria beyond the level of conformance claimed that have been met. This information should be provided in a form that users can use, preferably machine-readable metadata.
  * A list of the specific technologies that are " _used but not[relied upon](#dfn-relied-upon "the content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported")_."
  * A list of user agents, including assistive technologies that were used to test the content.
  * A list of specific accessibility characteristics of the content, provided in machine-readable metadata.
  * Information about any additional steps taken that go beyond the success criteria to enhance accessibility.
  * A machine-readable metadata version of the list of specific technologies that are [relied upon](#dfn-relied-upon "the content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported").
  * A machine-readable metadata version of the conformance claim.


Note 1
Refer to [Understanding Conformance Claims](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#conformance-claims) for more information and example conformance claims.
Note 2
Refer to [Understanding Metadata](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/understanding-metadata) for more information about the use of metadata in conformance claims.
### 5.4 Statement of Partial Conformance - Third Party Content
[](#conformance-partial)
Web pages that will later have additional content added can use a 'statement of partial conformance'. For example, an email program, a blog, an article that allows users to add comments, or applications supporting user-contributed content. Another example would be a page, such as a portal or news site, composed of content aggregated from multiple contributors, or sites that automatically insert content from other sources over time, such as when advertisements are inserted dynamically.
In these cases, it is not possible to know at the time of original posting what the uncontrolled content of the pages will be. It is important to note that the uncontrolled content can affect the accessibility of the controlled content as well. Two options are available:
  1. A determination of conformance can be made based on best knowledge. If a page of this type is monitored and repaired (non-conforming content is removed or brought into conformance) within two business days, then a determination or claim of conformance can be made since, except for errors in externally contributed content which are corrected or removed when encountered, the page conforms. No conformance claim can be made if it is not possible to monitor or correct non-conforming content;
**OR**
  2. A "statement of partial conformance" may be made that the page does not conform, but could conform if certain parts were removed. The form of that statement would be, "This page does not conform, but would conform to WCAG 2.2 at level X if the following parts from uncontrolled sources were removed." In addition, the following would also be true of uncontrolled content that is described in the statement of partial conformance:
     1. It is not content that is under the author's control.
     2. It is described in a way that users can identify (e.g., they cannot be described as "all parts that we do not control" unless they are clearly marked as such.)


### 5.5 Statement of Partial Conformance - Language
[](#conformance-partial-lang)
A "statement of partial conformance due to language" may be made when the page does not conform, but would conform if [accessibility support](#dfn-accessibility-supported "supported by users' assistive technologies as well as the accessibility features in browsers and other user agents") existed for (all of) the language(s) used on the page. The form of that statement would be, "This page does not conform, but would conform to WCAG 2.2 at level X if accessibility support existed for the following language(s):"
### 5.6 Privacy Considerations
[](#privacy-summary)
 _This section is non-normative._
Success criteria within this specification which the Working Group has identified possible implications for privacy, either by providing protections for end users or which are important for website providers to take in to consideration when implementing features designed to protect user privacy, are listed below.

### 5.7 Security Considerations
[](#security-summary)
 _This section is non-normative._
Success criteria within this specification which the Working Group has identified possible implications for security, either by providing protections for end users or which are important for website providers to take in to consideration when implementing features designed to protect user security, are listed below.

## 6\. Glossary
[](#glossary)
abbreviation
    
shortened form of a word, phrase, or name where the abbreviation has not become part of the language 
Note 1
This includes initialisms and acronyms where:
  1. **initialisms** are shortened forms of a name or phrase made from the initial letters of words or syllables contained in that name or phrase 
Note 2
Not defined in all languages.
Example 1
SNCF is a French initialism that contains the initial letters of the Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer, the French national railroad. 
Example 2
ESP is an initialism for extrasensory perception.
  2. **acronyms** are abbreviated forms made from the initial letters or parts of other words (in a name or phrase) which may be pronounced as a word 
Example 3
NOAA is an acronym made from the initial letters of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States. 


Note 3
Some companies have adopted what used to be an initialism as their company name. In these cases, the new name of the company is the letters (for example, Ecma) and the word is no longer considered an abbreviation. 
accessibility supported
    
supported by users' [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technologies "hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents") as well as the accessibility features in browsers and other [user agents](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users")
To qualify as an accessibility-supported use of a web content technology (or feature of a technology), both 1 and 2 must be satisfied for a web content technology (or feature): 
  1. **The way that the[web content technology](#dfn-technologies "mechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents") is used must be supported by users' assistive technology (AT). ** This means that the way that the technology is used has been tested for interoperability with users' assistive technology in the [human language(s)](#dfn-human-language-s "language that is spoken, written or signed \(through visual or tactile means\) to communicate with humans") of the content, 
**AND**
  2. **The web content technology must have accessibility-supported user agents that are available to users.** This means that at least one of the following four statements is true: 
     1. The technology is supported natively in widely-distributed user agents that are also accessibility supported (such as HTML and CSS); 
**OR**
     2. The technology is supported in a widely-distributed plug-in that is also accessibility supported; 
**OR**
     3. The content is available in a closed environment, such as a university or corporate network, where the user agent required by the technology and used by the organization is also accessibility supported; 
**OR**
     4. The user agent(s) that support the technology are accessibility supported and are available for download or purchase in a way that: 
        * does not cost a person with a disability any more than a person without a disability **and**
        * is as easy to find and obtain for a person with a disability as it is for a person without disabilities. 


Note 1
The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group and the W3C do not specify which or how much support by assistive technologies there must be for a particular use of a web technology in order for it to be classified as accessibility supported. (See [Level of Assistive Technology Support Needed for "Accessibility Support"](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#support-level).) 
Note 2
Web technologies can be used in ways that are not accessibility supported as long as they are not [relied upon](#dfn-relied-upon "the content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported") and the page as a whole meets the conformance requirements, including [Conformance Requirement 4](#cc4) and [Conformance Requirement 5](#cc5). 
Note 3
When a [web technology](#dfn-technologies "mechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents") is used in a way that is "accessibility supported," it does not imply that the entire technology or all uses of the technology are supported. Most technologies, including HTML, lack support for at least one feature or use. Pages conform to WCAG only if the uses of the technology that are accessibility supported can be relied upon to meet WCAG requirements. 
Note 4
When citing web content technologies that have multiple versions, the version(s) supported should be specified. 
Note 5
One way for authors to locate uses of a technology that are accessibility supported would be to consult compilations of uses that are documented to be accessibility supported. (See [Understanding Accessibility-Supported Web Technology Uses](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#documented-lists).) Authors, companies, technology vendors, or others may document accessibility-supported ways of using web content technologies. However, all ways of using technologies in the documentation would need to meet the definition of accessibility-supported Web content technologies above. 
alternative for time-based media
    
document including correctly sequenced text descriptions of time-based visual and auditory information and providing a means for achieving the outcomes of any time-based interaction 
Note
A screenplay used to create the synchronized media content would meet this definition only if it was corrected to accurately represent the final synchronized media after editing. 
ambiguous to users in general
    
the purpose cannot be determined from the link and all information of the web page presented to the user simultaneously with the link (i.e., readers without disabilities would not know what a link would do until they activated it) 
Example
The word guava in the following sentence "One of the notable exports is guava" is a link. The link could lead to a definition of guava, a chart listing the quantity of guava exported or a photograph of people harvesting guava. Until the link is activated, all readers are unsure and the person with a disability is not at any disadvantage. 
ASCII art
    
picture created by a spatial arrangement of characters or glyphs (typically from the 95 printable characters defined by ASCII) 
assistive technology (as used in this document) 
    
hardware and/or software that acts as a [user agent](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users"), or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents 
Note 1
Functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make tables more accessible). 
Note 2
Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents by using and monitoring APIs. 
Note 3
The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving web content from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles. 
Example
Assistive technologies that are important in the context of this document include the following: 
  * screen magnifiers, and other visual reading assistants, which are used by people with visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing, color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order to improve the visual readability of rendered text and images; 
  * screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information through synthesized speech or braille; 
  * text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech; 
  * speech recognition software, which may be used by people who have some physical disabilities;
  * alternative keyboards, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate the keyboard (including alternate keyboards that use head pointers, single switches, sip/puff and other special input devices.); 
  * alternative pointing devices, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate mouse pointing and button activations. 


audio
    
the technology of sound reproduction
Note
Audio can be created synthetically (including speech synthesis), recorded from real world sounds, or both. 
audio description
    
narration added to the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone 
Note 1
Audio description of [video](#dfn-video "the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images") provides information about actions, characters, scene changes, on-screen text, and other visual content. 
Note 2
In standard audio description, narration is added during existing pauses in dialogue. (See also [extended audio description](#dfn-extended-audio-description "audio description that is added to an audiovisual presentation by pausing the video so that there is time to add additional description").) 
Note 3
Where all of the [video](#dfn-video "the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images") information is already provided in existing [audio](#dfn-audio "the technology of sound reproduction"), no additional audio description is necessary. 
Note 4
Also called "video description" and "descriptive narration."
audio-only
    
a time-based presentation that contains only [audio](#dfn-audio "the technology of sound reproduction") (no [video](#dfn-video "the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images") and no interaction) 
blinking
    
switch back and forth between two visual states in a way that is meant to draw attention
Note
See also [flash](#dfn-flashes "a pair of opposing changes in relative luminance that can cause seizures in some people if it is large enough and in the right frequency range"). It is possible for something to be large enough and blink brightly enough at the right frequency to be also classified as a flash. 
blocks of text
    
more than one sentence of text
CAPTCHA
    
initialism for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart" 
Note 1
CAPTCHA tests often involve asking the user to type in text that is displayed in an obscured image or audio file. 
Note 2
A Turing test is any system of tests designed to differentiate a human from a computer. It is named after famed computer scientist Alan Turing. The term was coined by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. 
captions
    
synchronized visual and/or [text alternative](#dfn-text-alternative "Text that is programmatically associated with non-text content or referred to from text that is programmatically associated with non-text content. Programmatically associated text is text whose location can be programmatically determined from the non-text content.") for both speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the media content 
Note 1
Captions are similar to dialogue-only subtitles except captions convey not only the content of spoken dialogue, but also equivalents for non-dialogue audio information needed to understand the program content, including sound effects, music, laughter, speaker identification and location. 
Note 2
Closed Captions are equivalents that can be turned on and off with some players.
Note 3
Open Captions are any captions that cannot be turned off. For example, if the captions are visual equivalent [images of text](#dfn-images-of-text "text that has been rendered in a non-text form \(e.g., an image\) in order to achieve a particular visual effect") embedded in [video](#dfn-video "the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images"). 
Note 4
Captions should not obscure or obstruct relevant information in the video.
Note 5
In some countries, captions are called subtitles.
Note 6
[Audio descriptions](#dfn-audio-descriptions "narration added to the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone") can be, but do not need to be, captioned since they are descriptions of information that is already presented visually. 
changes of context
    
major changes that, if made without user awareness, can disorient users who are not able to view the entire page simultaneously 
Changes in context include changes of:
  * [user agent](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users"); 
  * [viewport](#dfn-viewport "object in which the user agent presents content"); 
  * focus;
  * [content](#dfn-content "information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a user agent, including code or markup that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions") that changes the meaning of the [web page](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent")


Note
A change of content is not always a change of context. Changes in content, such as an expanding outline, dynamic menu, or a tab control do not necessarily change the context, unless they also change one of the above (e.g., focus). 
Example
Opening a new window, moving focus to a different component, going to a new page (including anything that would look to a user as if they had moved to a new page) or significantly re-arranging the content of a page are examples of changes of context. 
cognitive function test
    
New
A task that requires the user to remember, manipulate, or transcribe information. Examples include, but are not limited to:
  * memorization, such as remembering a username, password, set of characters, images, or patterns. The common identifiers name, e-mail, and phone number are not considered cognitive function tests as they are personal to the user and consistent across websites;
  * transcription, such as typing in characters;
  * use of correct spelling;
  * performance of calculations;
  * solving of puzzles.


conformance
    
satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification
conforming alternate version
    
version that
  1. conforms at the designated level, and
  2. provides all of the same information and [functionality](#dfn-functionality "processes and outcomes achievable through user action") in the same [human language](#dfn-human-language-s "language that is spoken, written or signed \(through visual or tactile means\) to communicate with humans"), and 
  3. is as up to date as the non-conforming content, and
  4. for which at least one of the following is true:
     1. the conforming version can be reached from the non-conforming page via an [accessibility-supported](#dfn-accessibility-supported "supported by users' assistive technologies as well as the accessibility features in browsers and other user agents") [mechanism](#dfn-mechanism "process or technique for achieving a result"), or 
     2. the non-conforming version can only be reached from the conforming version, or
     3. the non-conforming version can only be reached from a conforming page that also provides a mechanism to reach the conforming version 


Note 1
In this definition, "can only be reached" means that there is some mechanism, such as a conditional redirect, that prevents a user from "reaching" (loading) the non-conforming page unless the user had just come from the conforming version. 
Note 2
The alternate version does not need to be matched page for page with the original (e.g., the conforming alternate version may consist of multiple pages). 
Note 3
If multiple language versions are available, then conforming alternate versions are required for each language offered. 
Note 4
Alternate versions may be provided to accommodate different technology environments or user groups. Each version should be as conformant as possible. One version would need to be fully conformant in order to meet [conformance requirement 1](#cc1). 
Note 5
The conforming alternative version does not need to reside within the scope of conformance, or even on the same website, as long as it is as freely available as the non-conforming version. 
Note 6
Alternate versions should not be confused with [supplementary content](#dfn-supplementary-content "additional content that illustrates or clarifies the primary content"), which support the original page and enhance comprehension. 
Note 7
Setting user preferences within the content to produce a conforming version is an acceptable mechanism for reaching another version as long as the method used to set the preferences is accessibility supported. 
See [Understanding Conforming Alternate Versions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#conforming-alt-versions)
content (web content) 
    
information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a [user agent](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users"), including code or markup that defines the content's [structure](#dfn-structure "The way the parts of a web page are organized in relation to each other; and The way a collection of web pages is organized"), [presentation](#dfn-presentation "rendering of the content in a form to be perceived by users"), and interactions 
context-sensitive help
    
help text that provides information related to the function currently being performed
Note
Clear labels can act as context-sensitive help.
contrast ratio
    
(L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05), where
  * L1 is the [relative luminance](#dfn-relative-luminance "the relative brightness of any point in a colorspace, normalized to 0 for darkest black and 1 for lightest white") of the lighter of the colors, and 
  * L2 is the [relative luminance](#dfn-relative-luminance "the relative brightness of any point in a colorspace, normalized to 0 for darkest black and 1 for lightest white") of the darker of the colors. 


Note 1
Contrast ratios can range from 1 to 21 (commonly written 1:1 to 21:1).
Note 2
Because authors do not have control over user settings as to how text is rendered (for example font smoothing or anti-aliasing), the contrast ratio for text can be evaluated with anti-aliasing turned off. 
Note 3
For the purpose of Success Criteria 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast is measured with respect to the specified background over which the text is rendered in normal usage. If no background color is specified, then white is assumed. 
Note 4
Background color is the specified color of content over which the text is to be rendered in normal usage. It is a failure if no background color is specified when the text color is specified, because the user's default background color is unknown and cannot be evaluated for sufficient contrast. For the same reason, it is a failure if no text color is specified when a background color is specified. 
Note 5
When there is a border around the letter, the border can add contrast and would be used in calculating the contrast between the letter and its background. A narrow border around the letter would be used as the letter. A wide border around the letter that fills in the inner details of the letters acts as a halo and would be considered background. 
Note 6
WCAG conformance should be evaluated for color pairs specified in the content that an author would expect to appear adjacent in typical presentation. Authors need not consider unusual presentations, such as color changes made by the user agent, except where caused by authors' code. 
correct reading sequence
    
any sequence where words and paragraphs are presented in an order that does not change the meaning of the content 
CSS pixel
    
visual angle of about 0.0213 degrees
A CSS pixel is the canonical unit of measure for all lengths and measurements in CSS. This unit is density-independent, and distinct from actual hardware pixels present in a display. User agents and operating systems should ensure that a CSS pixel is set as closely as possible to the [CSS Values and Units Module Level 3 reference pixel](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#reference-pixel) [[css3-values](#bib-css3-values "CSS Values and Units Module Level 3")], which takes into account the physical dimensions of the display and the assumed viewing distance (factors that cannot be determined by content authors). 
down-event
    
platform event that occurs when the trigger stimulus of a pointer is depressed
The down-event may have different names on different platforms, such as "touchstart" or "mousedown".
dragging movement
    
New
an operation where the pointer engages with an element on the [down-event](#dfn-down-event "platform event that occurs when the trigger stimulus of a pointer is depressed") and the element (or a representation of its position) follows the pointer until an [up-event](#dfn-up-event "platform event that occurs when the trigger stimulus of a pointer is released")
Note
Examples of draggable elements include list items, text elements, and images.
emergency
    
a sudden, unexpected situation or occurrence that requires immediate action to preserve health, safety, or property 
essential
    
if removed, would fundamentally change the information or functionality of the content, **and** information and functionality cannot be achieved in another way that would conform 
extended audio description
    
audio description that is added to an audiovisual presentation by pausing the [video](#dfn-video "the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images") so that there is time to add additional description 
Note
This technique is only used when the sense of the [video](#dfn-video "the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images") would be lost without the additional [audio description](#dfn-audio-descriptions "narration added to the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone") and the pauses between dialogue/narration are too short. 
flash
    
a pair of opposing changes in [relative luminance](#dfn-relative-luminance "the relative brightness of any point in a colorspace, normalized to 0 for darkest black and 1 for lightest white") that can cause seizures in some people if it is large enough and in the right frequency range 
Note 1
See [general flash and red flash thresholds](#dfn-general-flash-and-red-flash-thresholds "a flash or rapidly changing image sequence is below the threshold \(i.e., content passes\) if any of the following are true:") for information about types of flash that are not allowed. 
Note 2
See also [blinking](#dfn-blinking "switch back and forth between two visual states in a way that is meant to draw attention"). 
focus indicator
    
New
pixels that are changed to visually indicate when a [user interface component](#dfn-user-interface-components "a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function") is in a focused [state](#dfn-states "dynamic property expressing characteristics of a user interface component that may change in response to user action or automated processes")
functionality
    
[processes](#dfn-processes "series of user actions where each action is required in order to complete an activity") and outcomes achievable through user action 
general flash and red flash thresholds
    
a [flash](#dfn-flashes "a pair of opposing changes in relative luminance that can cause seizures in some people if it is large enough and in the right frequency range") or rapidly changing image sequence is below the threshold (i.e., content **passes**) if any of the following are true: 
  * there are no more than three **general flashes** and / or no more than three **red flashes** within any one-second period; or 
  * the combined area of flashes occurring concurrently occupies no more than a total of .006 steradians within any 10 degree visual field on the screen (25% of any 10 degree visual field on the screen) at typical viewing distance 


where:
  * A **general flash** is defined as a pair of opposing changes in [relative luminance](#dfn-relative-luminance "the relative brightness of any point in a colorspace, normalized to 0 for darkest black and 1 for lightest white") of 10% or more of the maximum relative luminance (1.0) where the relative luminance of the darker image is below 0.80; and where "a pair of opposing changes" is an increase followed by a decrease, or a decrease followed by an increase, and 
  * A **red flash** is defined as any pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red 


_Exception:_ Flashing that is a fine, balanced, pattern such as white noise or an alternating checkerboard pattern with "squares" smaller than 0.1 degree (of visual field at typical viewing distance) on a side does not violate the thresholds. 
Note 1
For general software or web content, using a 341 x 256 pixel rectangle anywhere on the displayed screen area when the content is viewed at 1024 x 768 pixels will provide a good estimate of a 10 degree visual field for standard screen sizes and viewing distances (e.g., 15-17 inch screen at 22-26 inches). This resolution of 75 - 85 ppi is known to be lower, and thus more conservative than the nominal CSS pixel resolution of 96 ppi in CSS specifications. Higher resolutions displays showing the same rendering of the content yield smaller and safer images so it is lower resolutions that are used to define the thresholds. 
Note 2
A transition is the change in relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for red flashing) between adjacent peaks and valleys in a plot of relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for red flashing) measurement against time. A flash consists of two opposing transitions. 
Note 3
The new working definition in the field for **"pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red"** (from WCAG 2.2) is a pair of opposing transitions where, one transition is either to or from a state with a value R/(R + G + B) that is greater than or equal to 0.8, and the difference between states is more than 0.2 (unitless) in the CIE 1976 UCS chromaticity diagram. [[ISO_9241-391](#bib-iso_9241-391 "Ergonomics of human-system interaction—Part 391: Requirements, analysis and compliance test methods for the reduction of photosensitive seizures")] 
Note 4
Tools are available that will carry out analysis from video screen capture. However, no tool is necessary to evaluate for this condition if flashing is less than or equal to 3 flashes in any one second. Content automatically passes (see #1 and #2 above). 
human language
    
language that is spoken, written or signed (through visual or tactile means) to communicate with humans 
Note
See also [sign language](#dfn-sign-language "a language using combinations of movements of the hands and arms, facial expressions, or body positions to convey meaning"). 
idiom
    
phrase whose meaning cannot be deduced from the meaning of the individual words and the specific words cannot be changed without losing the meaning 
Note
Idioms cannot be translated directly, word for word, without losing their (cultural or language-dependent) meaning. 
Example 1
In English, "spilling the beans" means "revealing a secret." However, "knocking over the beans" or "spilling the vegetables" does not mean the same thing. 
Example 2
In Japanese, the phrase "さじを投げる" literally translates into "he throws a spoon," but it means that there is nothing he can do and finally he gives up. 
Example 3
In Dutch, "Hij ging met de kippen op stok" literally translates into "He went to roost with the chickens," but it means that he went to bed early. 
image of text
    
text that has been rendered in a non-text form (e.g., an image) in order to achieve a particular visual effect 
Note
This does not include text that is part of a picture that contains significant other visual content. 
Example
A person's name on a nametag in a photograph.
informative
    
for information purposes and not required for conformance
Note
Content required for [conformance](#dfn-conform "satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification") is referred to as "[normative](#dfn-normative "required for conformance")."
input error
    
information provided by the user that is not accepted
Note
This includes:
  1. Information that is required by the [web page](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent") but omitted by the user 
  2. Information that is provided by the user but that falls outside the required data format or values 


jargon
    
words used in a particular way by people in a particular field
Example
The word StickyKeys is jargon from the field of assistive technology/accessibility.
keyboard interface
    
interface used by software to obtain keystroke input
Note 1
A keyboard interface allows users to provide keystroke input to programs even if the native technology does not contain a keyboard.
Example
A touchscreen PDA has a keyboard interface built into its operating system as well as a connector for external keyboards. Applications on the PDA can use the interface to obtain keyboard input either from an external keyboard or from other applications that provide simulated keyboard output, such as handwriting interpreters or speech-to-text applications with "keyboard emulation" functionality.
Note 2
Operation of the application (or parts of the application) through a keyboard-operated mouse emulator, such as MouseKeys, does not qualify as operation through a keyboard interface because operation of the program is through its pointing device interface, not through its keyboard interface. 
keyboard shortcut
    
alternative means of triggering an action by the pressing of one or more keys
label
    
[text](#dfn-text "sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined, where the sequence is expressing something in human language") or other component with a [text alternative](#dfn-text-alternative "Text that is programmatically associated with non-text content or referred to from text that is programmatically associated with non-text content. Programmatically associated text is text whose location can be programmatically determined from the non-text content.") that is presented to a user to identify a component within web [content](#dfn-content "information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a user agent, including code or markup that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions")
Note 1
A label is presented to all users whereas the [name](#dfn-name "text by which software can identify a component within web content to the user") may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology. In many (but not all) cases the name and the label are the same. 
Note 2
The term label is not limited to the label element in HTML.
large scale (text) 
    
with at least 18 point or 14 point bold or font size that would yield equivalent size for Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) fonts 
Note 1
Fonts with extraordinarily thin strokes or unusual features and characteristics that reduce the familiarity of their letter forms are harder to read, especially at lower contrast levels. 
Note 2
Font size is the size when the content is delivered. It does not include resizing that may be done by a user. 
Note 3
The actual size of the character that a user sees is dependent both on the author-defined size and the user's display or user agent settings. For many mainstream body text fonts, 14 and 18 point is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of the default size for body text (assuming that the body font is 100%), but authors would need to check this for the particular fonts in use. When fonts are defined in relative units, the actual point size is calculated by the user agent for display. The point size should be obtained from the user agent, or calculated based on font metrics as the user agent does, when evaluating this success criterion. Users who have low vision would be responsible for choosing appropriate settings. 
Note 4
When using text without specifying the font size, the smallest font size used on major browsers for unspecified text would be a reasonable size to assume for the font. If a level 1 heading is rendered in 14pt bold or higher on major browsers, then it would be reasonable to assume it is large text. Relative scaling can be calculated from the default sizes in a similar fashion. 
Note 5
The 18 and 14 point sizes for roman texts are taken from the minimum size for large print (14pt) and the larger standard font size (18pt). For other fonts such as CJK languages, the "equivalent" sizes would be the minimum large print size used for those languages and the next larger standard large print size. 
legal commitments
    
transactions where the person incurs a legally binding obligation or benefit
Example
A marriage license, a stock trade (financial and legal), a will, a loan, adoption, signing up for the army, a contract of any type, etc. 
link purpose
    
nature of the result obtained by activating a hyperlink
live
    
information captured from a real-world event and transmitted to the receiver with no more than a broadcast delay 
Note 1
A broadcast delay is a short (usually automated) delay, for example used in order to give the broadcaster time to cue or censor the audio (or video) feed, but not sufficient to allow significant editing. 
Note 2
If information is completely computer generated, it is not live.
lower secondary education level
    
the two or three year period of education that begins after completion of six years of school and ends nine years after the beginning of [primary education](#dfn-primary-education "six year time period that begins between the ages of five and seven, possibly without any previous education")
Note
This definition is based on the International Standard Classification of Education [[UNESCO](#bib-unesco "International Standard Classification of Education")]. 
mechanism
    
[process](#dfn-processes "series of user actions where each action is required in order to complete an activity") or technique for achieving a result 
Note 1
The mechanism may be explicitly provided in the content, or may be [relied upon](#dfn-relied-upon "the content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported") to be provided by either the platform or by [user agents](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users"), including [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technologies "hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents"). 
Note 2
The mechanism needs to meet all success criteria for the conformance level claimed.
media alternative for text
    
media that presents no more information than is already presented in text (directly or via text alternatives) 
Note
A media alternative for text is provided for those who benefit from alternate representations of text. Media alternatives for text may be audio-only, video-only (including sign-language video), or audio-video. 
motion animation
    
addition of steps between conditions to create the illusion of movement or to give a sense of a smooth transition
Example
For example, an element which moves into place or changes size while appearing is considered to be animated. An element which appears instantly without transitioning is not using animation. Motion animation does not include changes of color, blurring, or opacity which do not change the perceived size, shape, or position of the element.
minimum bounding box
    
New
the smallest enclosing rectangle aligned to the horizontal axis within which all the points of a shape lie. For components which wrap onto multiple lines as part of a sentence or [block of text](#dfn-blocks-of-text "more than one sentence of text") (such as hypertext links), the bounding box is based on how the component would appear on a single line.
name
    
text by which software can identify a component within web content to the user
Note 1
The name may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology, whereas a [label](#dfn-labels "text or other component with a text alternative that is presented to a user to identify a component within web content") is presented to all users. In many (but not all) cases, the label and the name are the same. 
Note 2
This is unrelated to the name attribute in HTML.
navigated sequentially
    
navigated in the order defined for advancing focus (from one element to the next) using a [keyboard interface](#dfn-keyboard-interface "interface used by software to obtain keystroke input")
non-text content
    
any content that is not a sequence of characters that can be [programmatically determined](#dfn-programmatically-determinable "determined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different user agents, including assistive technologies, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities") or where the sequence is not expressing something in [human language](#dfn-human-language-s "language that is spoken, written or signed \(through visual or tactile means\) to communicate with humans")
Note
This includes [ASCII art](#dfn-ascii-art "picture created by a spatial arrangement of characters or glyphs \(typically from the 95 printable characters defined by ASCII\)") (which is a pattern of characters), emoticons, leetspeak (which uses character substitution), and images representing text 
normative
    
required for conformance
Note 1
One may conform in a variety of well-defined ways to this document.
Note 2
Content identified as "[informative](#dfn-informative "for information purposes and not required for conformance")" or "non-normative" is never required for [conformance](#dfn-conform "satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification").
on a full-screen window
    
on the most common sized desktop/laptop display with the [viewport](#dfn-viewport "object in which the user agent presents content") maximized
Note
Since people generally keep their computers for several years, it is best not to rely on the latest desktop/laptop display resolutions but to consider the common desktop/laptop display resolutions over the course of several years when making this evaluation. 
paused
    
stopped by user request and not resumed until requested by user
perimeter
    
New
continuous line forming the boundary of a shape not including shared pixels, or the [minimum bounding box](#dfn-bounding-boxes "New"), whichever is shortest.
Example
The perimeter calculation for a 2 CSS pixel perimeter around a rectangle is 4 _h_ +4 _w_ , where _h_ is the height and _w_ is the width. For a 2 CSS pixel perimeter around a circle it is 4𝜋 _r_.
pointer input
    
input from a device that can target a specific coordinate (or set of coordinates) on a screen, such as a mouse, pen, or touch contact 
Note
See the [Pointer Events definition for "pointer"](https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/#dfn-pointer) [[pointerevents](#bib-pointerevents "Pointer Events")].
prerecorded
    
information that is not [live](#dfn-live "information captured from a real-world event and transmitted to the receiver with no more than a broadcast delay")
presentation
    
rendering of the [content](#dfn-content "information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a user agent, including code or markup that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions") in a form to be perceived by users 
primary education level
    
six year time period that begins between the ages of five and seven, possibly without any previous education 
Note
This definition is based on the International Standard Classification of Education [[UNESCO](#bib-unesco "International Standard Classification of Education")]. 
process
    
series of user actions where each action is required in order to complete an activity
Example 1
Successful use of a series of web pages on a shopping site requires users to view alternative products, prices and offers, select products, submit an order, provide shipping information and provide payment information. 
Example 2
An account registration page requires successful completion of a [Turing test](https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/) before the registration form can be accessed. 
programmatically determined (programmatically determinable) 
    
determined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different [user agents](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users"), including [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technologies "hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents"), can extract and present this information to users in different modalities 
Example 1
Determined in a markup language from elements and attributes that are accessed directly by commonly available assistive technology. 
Example 2
Determined from technology-specific data structures in a non-markup language and exposed to assistive technology via an accessibility API that is supported by commonly available assistive technology. 
programmatically determined link context
    
additional information that can be [programmatically determined](#dfn-programmatically-determinable "determined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different user agents, including assistive technologies, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities") from [relationships](#dfn-relationships "meaningful associations between distinct pieces of content") with a link, combined with the link text, and presented to users in different modalities 
Example
In HTML, information that is programmatically determinable from a link in English includes text that is in the same [paragraph](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#paragraph), list item, or table cell as the link or in a table header cell that is associated with the table cell that contains the link. 
Note
Since screen readers interpret punctuation, they can also provide the context from the current sentence, when the focus is on a link in that sentence. 
programmatically set
    
set by software using methods that are supported by [user agents](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users"), including [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technologies "hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents")
pure decoration
    
serving only an aesthetic purpose, providing no information, and having no functionality
Note
Text is only purely decorative if the words can be rearranged or substituted without changing their purpose. 
Example
The cover page of a dictionary has random words in very light text in the background.
real-time event
    
event that a) occurs at the same time as the viewing and b) is not completely generated by the content 
Example 1
A Webcast of a live performance (occurs at the same time as the viewing and is not prerecorded). 
Example 2
An on-line auction with people bidding (occurs at the same time as the viewing).
Example 3
Live humans interacting in a virtual world using avatars (is not completely generated by the content and occurs at the same time as the viewing). 
region
    
perceivable, [programmatically determined](#dfn-programmatically-determinable "determined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different user agents, including assistive technologies, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities") [section](#dfn-section "a self-contained portion of written content that deals with one or more related topics or thoughts") of content
Note
In HTML, any area designated with a landmark role would be a region.
relationships
    
meaningful associations between distinct pieces of content
relative luminance
    
the relative brightness of any point in a colorspace, normalized to 0 for darkest black and 1 for lightest white 
Note 1
For the sRGB colorspace, the relative luminance of a color is defined as L = 0.2126 * **R** \+ 0.7152 * **G** \+ 0.0722 * **B** where **R** , **G** and **B** are defined as: 
  * if RsRGB <= 0.04045 then **R** = RsRGB/12.92 else **R** = ((RsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4 
  * if GsRGB <= 0.04045 then **G** = GsRGB/12.92 else **G** = ((GsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4 
  * if BsRGB <= 0.04045 then **B** = BsRGB/12.92 else **B** = ((BsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4 


and RsRGB, GsRGB, and BsRGB are defined as:
  * RsRGB = R8bit/255
  * GsRGB = G8bit/255
  * BsRGB = B8bit/255


The "^" character is the exponentiation operator. (Formula taken from [[SRGB](#bib-srgb "Multimedia systems and equipment - Colour measurement and management - Part 2-1: Colour management - Default RGB colour space - sRGB")].) 
Note 2
Before May 2021 the value of 0.04045 in the definition was different (0.03928). It was taken from an older version of the specification and has been updated. It has no practical effect on the calculations in the context of these guidelines.
Note 3
Almost all systems used today to view web content assume sRGB encoding. Unless it is known that another color space will be used to process and display the content, authors should evaluate using sRGB colorspace. If using other color spaces, see [Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum). 
Note 4
If dithering occurs after delivery, then the source color value is used. For colors that are dithered at the source, the average values of the colors that are dithered should be used (average R, average G, and average B). 
Note 5
Tools are available that automatically do the calculations when testing contrast and flash. 
Note 6
A [separate page giving the relative luminance definition using MathML](relative-luminance.html) to display the formulas is available. 
relied upon (technologies that are) 
    
the content would not [conform](#dfn-conform "satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification") if that [technology](#dfn-technologies "mechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents") is turned off or is not supported 
role
    
text or number by which software can identify the function of a component within Web content 
Example
A number that indicates whether an image functions as a hyperlink, command button, or check box. 
same functionality
    
same result when used
Example
A submit "search" button on one web page and a "find" button on another web page may both have a field to enter a term and list topics in the website related to the term submitted. In this case, they would have the same functionality but would not be labeled consistently. 
same relative order
    
same position relative to other items
Note
Items are considered to be in the same relative order even if other items are inserted or removed from the original order. For example, expanding navigation menus may insert an additional level of detail or a secondary navigation section may be inserted into the reading order. 
satisfies a success criterion
    
the success criterion does not evaluate to 'false' when applied to the page
section
    
a self-contained portion of written content that deals with one or more related topics or thoughts 
Note
A section may consist of one or more paragraphs and include graphics, tables, lists and sub-sections. 
set of web pages
    
collection of [web pages](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent") that share a common purpose and that are created by the same author, group or organization 
Example
Examples include:
  * a publication which is split across multiple web pages, where each page contains one chapter or other significant section of the work. The publication is logically a single contiguous unit, and contains navigation features that enable access to the full set of pages.
  * an e-commerce website shows products in a set of web pages that all share the same navigation and identification. However, when progressing to the checkout process, the template changes; the navigation and other elements are removed, so the pages in that process are functionally and visually different. The checkout pages are not part of the set of product pages.
  * a blog on a sub-domain (e.g. blog.example.com) which has a different navigation and is authored by a distinct set of people from the pages on the primary domain (example.com).


Note
Different language versions would be considered different sets of web pages.
sign language
    
a language using combinations of movements of the hands and arms, facial expressions, or body positions to convey meaning 
sign language interpretation
    
translation of one language, generally a spoken language, into a [sign language](#dfn-sign-language "a language using combinations of movements of the hands and arms, facial expressions, or body positions to convey meaning")
Note
True sign languages are independent languages that are unrelated to the spoken language(s) of the same country or region. 
single pointer
    
an input modality that only targets a single point on the page/screen at a time – such as a mouse, single finger on a touch screen, or stylus.
Note
Single pointer interactions include clicks, double clicks, taps, dragging motions, and single-finger swipe gestures. In contrast, multipoint interactions involve the use of two or more pointers at the same time, such as two-finger interactions on a touchscreen, or the simultaneous use of a mouse and stylus.
specific sensory experience
    
a sensory experience that is not purely decorative and does not primarily convey important information or perform a function 
Example
Examples include a performance of a flute solo, works of visual art etc.
state
    
dynamic property expressing characteristics of a [user interface component](#dfn-user-interface-components "a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function") that may change in response to user action or automated processes
States do not affect the nature of the component, but represent data associated with the component or user interaction possibilities. Examples include focus, hover, select, press, check, visited/unvisited, and expand/collapse.
status message
    
change in content that is not a [change of context](#dfn-change-of-context "major changes that, if made without user awareness, can disorient users who are not able to view the entire page simultaneously"), and that provides information to the user on the success or results of an action, on the waiting state of an application, on the progress of a [process](#dfn-processes "series of user actions where each action is required in order to complete an activity"), or on the existence of errors
structure
    
  * The way the parts of a [web page](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent") are organized in relation to each other; and 
  * The way a collection of [web pages](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent") is organized 


style property
    
property whose value determines the presentation (e.g. font, color, size, location, padding, volume, synthesized speech prosody) of content elements as they are rendered (e.g. onscreen, via loudspeaker, via braille display) by user agents
Style properties can have several origins:
  * User agent default styles: The default style property values applied in the absence of any author or user styles. Some web content technologies specify a default rendering, others do not;
  * Author styles: Style property values that are set by the author as part of the content (e.g. in-line styles, author style sheets);
  * User styles: Style property values that are set by the user (e.g. via user agent interface settings, user style sheets)


supplemental content
    
additional [content](#dfn-content "information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a user agent, including code or markup that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions") that illustrates or clarifies the primary content 
Example 1
An audio version of a [web page](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent"). 
Example 2
An illustration of a complex [process](#dfn-processes "series of user actions where each action is required in order to complete an activity"). 
Example 3
A paragraph summarizing the major outcomes and recommendations made in a research study. 
synchronized media
    
[audio](#dfn-audio "the technology of sound reproduction") or [video](#dfn-video "the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images") synchronized with another format for presenting information and/or with time-based interactive components, unless the media is a [media alternative for text](#dfn-media-alternative-for-text "media that presents no more information than is already presented in text \(directly or via text alternatives\)") that is clearly labeled as such 
target
    
region of the display that will accept a pointer action, such as the interactive area of a [user interface component](#dfn-user-interface-components "a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function")
Note
If two or more targets are overlapping, the overlapping area should not be included in the measurement of the target size, except when the overlapping targets perform the same action or open the same page.
technology (web content) 
    
[mechanism](#dfn-mechanism "process or technique for achieving a result") for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by [user agents](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users")
Note 1
As used in these guidelines "web technology" and the word "technology" (when used alone) both refer to web content technologies. 
Note 2
Web content technologies may include markup languages, data formats, or programming languages that authors may use alone or in combination to create end-user experiences that range from static web pages to synchronized media presentations to dynamic Web applications. 
Example
Some common examples of web content technologies include HTML, CSS, SVG, PNG, PDF, Flash, and JavaScript. 
text
    
sequence of characters that can be [programmatically determined](#dfn-programmatically-determinable "determined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different user agents, including assistive technologies, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities"), where the sequence is expressing something in [human language](#dfn-human-language-s "language that is spoken, written or signed \(through visual or tactile means\) to communicate with humans")
text alternative
    
[Text](#dfn-text "sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined, where the sequence is expressing something in human language") that is programmatically associated with [non-text content](#dfn-non-text-content "any content that is not a sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined or where the sequence is not expressing something in human language") or referred to from text that is programmatically associated with non-text content. Programmatically associated text is text whose location can be [programmatically determined](#dfn-programmatically-determinable "determined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different user agents, including assistive technologies, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities") from the non-text content. 
Example
An image of a chart is described in text in the paragraph after the chart. The short text alternative for the chart indicates that a description follows. 
Note
Refer to [Understanding Text Alternatives](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#text-alternatives) for more information. 
up-event
    
platform event that occurs when the trigger stimulus of a pointer is released
The up-event may have different names on different platforms, such as "touchend" or "mouseup".
used in an unusual or restricted way
    
words used in such a way that requires users to know exactly which definition to apply in order to understand the content correctly 
Example
The term "gig" means something different if it occurs in a discussion of music concerts than it does in article about computer hard drive space, but the appropriate definition can be determined from context. By contrast, the word "text" is used in a very specific way in WCAG 2, so a definition is supplied in the glossary. 
user agent
    
any software that retrieves and presents web content for users
Example
Web browsers, media players, plug-ins, and other programs — including [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technologies "hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents") — that help in retrieving, rendering, and interacting with web content. 
user-controllable
    
data that is intended to be accessed by users
Note
This does not refer to such things as Internet logs and search engine monitoring data.
Example
Name and address fields for a user's account.
user interface component
    
a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function 
Note 1
Multiple user interface components may be implemented as a single programmatic element. "Components" here is not tied to programming techniques, but rather to what the user perceives as separate controls. 
Note 2
User interface components include form elements and links as well as components generated by scripts. 
Note 3
What is meant by "component" or "user interface component" here is also sometimes called "user interface element". 
Example
An applet has a "control" that can be used to move through content by line or page or random access. Since each of these would need to have a name and be settable independently, they would each be a "user interface component." 
user inactivity
    
any continuous period of time where no user actions occur
The method of tracking will be determined by the website or application.
video
    
the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images
Note
Video can be made up of animated or photographic images, or both.
video-only
    
a time-based presentation that contains only [video](#dfn-video "the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images") (no [audio](#dfn-audio "the technology of sound reproduction") and no interaction) 
viewport
    
object in which the [user agent](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users") presents content
Note 1
The user agent presents content through one or more viewports. Viewports include windows, frames, loudspeakers, and virtual magnifying glasses. A viewport may contain another viewport (e.g., nested frames). Interface components created by the user agent such as prompts, menus, and alerts are not viewports. 
Note 2
This definition is based on [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 Glossary](https://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT/glossary.html) [[UAAG10](#bib-uaag10 "User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0")]. 
visually customized
    
the font, size, color, and background can be set
web page
    
a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a [user agent](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users")
Note 1
Although any "other resources" would be rendered together with the primary resource, they would not necessarily be rendered simultaneously with each other. 
Note 2
For the purposes of conformance with these guidelines, a resource must be "non-embedded" within the scope of conformance to be considered a web page. 
Example 1
A web resource including all embedded images and media.
Example 2
A web mail program built using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX). The program lives entirely at http://example.com/mail, but includes an inbox, a contacts area and a calendar. Links or buttons are provided that cause the inbox, contacts, or calendar to display, but do not change the URI of the page as a whole. 
Example 3
A customizable portal site, where users can choose content to display from a set of different content modules. 
Example 4
When you enter "http://shopping.example.com/" in your browser, you enter a movie-like interactive shopping environment where you visually move around in a store dragging products off of the shelves around you and into a visual shopping cart in front of you. Clicking on a product causes it to be demonstrated with a specification sheet floating alongside. This might be a single-page website or just one page within a website. 
## 7\. Input Purposes for User Interface Components
[](#input-purposes)
This section contains a listing of common [user interface component](#dfn-user-interface-components "a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function") input purposes. The terms below are not keywords that must be used, but instead represent purposes that must be captured in the taxonomy adopted by a webpage. Where applicable, authors mark up controls with the chosen taxonomy to indicate the semantic purpose. This provides the potential for user agents and assistive technologies to apply personalized presentations that can enable more people to understand and use the content.
Note
The list of input type purposes is based on the control purposes defined in the [HTML specification's Autofill section](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#autofill), but it is important to understand that a different technology may have some or all of the same concepts defined in its specification and only the concepts that are mapped to the meanings below are required.
